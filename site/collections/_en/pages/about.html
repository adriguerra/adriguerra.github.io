        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        From the mountains of Switzerland to the vibrant culture of Guatemala, my journey has been one of contrasts, values, and experiences that shape my approach to e-commerce and marketing science.
        <br>
        <br>
        With an academic foundation in Communication Systems and Data Science from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL), I have long gravitated towards the complex and data-driven side of business. But even as I honed my technical skills, my upbringing left a lasting imprint, blending structure and tenacity—qualities I channel into my work every day.
        <br>
        <br>

        <h2>My Professional Journey</h2>
        <p align="justify">
        Starting out, I spent summers at Koch Industries, learning the nuances of commodities trading through the unpredictable shifts of energy markets. Those early experiences embedded in me a keen sense of how data, even in volatile settings, could unlock value—a perspective that fuels my current e-commerce strategies by emphasizing agility and precision in response to customer needs.
        <br>
        <br>
        After Koch, my entrepreneurial drive led me to launch a cannabis e-commerce startup, Cebedia, in Switzerland’s emerging CBD market. Here, I dove into the world of direct-to-consumer strategies, learning the unique challenges and rewards of commodity e-commerce for a new product type. Cebedia taught me about the intricacies of building trust in an evolving marketplace—insights that now help me shape effective, transparent brand narratives for clients in the e-commerce space.
        <br>
        <br>
        Next, as part of Capgemini’s data squad and later with OWT, I gained a dual perspective on tech consulting. I led both technical and project management roles, helping clients overcome challenges with legacy systems and innovate within digital frameworks. These experiences gave me a 360-degree view of how technology and data inform decisions at scale. I realized that data isn’t just a tool; it’s a pathway to creating streamlined customer experiences, which is now a central aspect of my e-commerce work.
        <br>
        <br>
      </p>
        <h2>Why Marketing Science?</h2>
        <p align="justify">
          Freelancing allowed me to crystallize my experiences into a focused approach: marketing science for e-commerce. The freedom of freelancing not only gave me the chance to work with a diverse array of clients across the globe but also to bring data-driven solutions to the forefront of digital marketing. By merging analytics with strategic storytelling, I empower brands to connect meaningfully with their customers, creating personalized and scalable solutions.
          <br>
          <br>
          Beyond my professional journey, freelancing also allowed me to cultivate balance. Whether practicing yoga or exploring music, I find that a well-rounded life complements my work in invaluable ways, keeping my insights fresh and adaptable. I am committed to helping e-commerce brands grow sustainably, creating harmony between commercial success and customer trust—just as I aim to balance progress and mindfulness in my own life.
