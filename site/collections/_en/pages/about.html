      <p align="justify">
        Born and raised in Geneva, Switzerland, I grew up in a household shaped by diplomacy and diversity—both my Guatemalan parents worked at the UN. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Little did I know that their global mindset would fuel my adventurous career journey.  
        <br>
        <br>
        My life so far has been a mix of bold pivots, steep learning curves, and a whole lot of passion.  
        <br>
        <br>
        It all started in the high-stakes world of commodity trading.
        While I was grateful for the incredible opportunities, the finance grind didn’t spark joy in me.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, I took a leap and launched a cannabis startup. 
        The highs were high (no pun intended) and the lows were low. I learned firsthand that startup life was no walk in the park.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Realizing I needed to level up, I stepped into the consulting world. 
        My first stop was Capgemini as a Data Analyst. The reality was more like playing data janitor for legacy systems. Not exactly thrilling. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Then came OWT, a place buzzing with entrepreneurial energy. It was there I learned to think big, take risks, and craft strategies that actually work—skills I still lean on every day.  
        <br>
        <br>
        When I ventured into freelancing as a data scientist, I hit another realization: technical skills alone weren’t enough to make it in this fast-paced, competitive world. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I had to master the art of selling myself, fast.
        <br>
        <br>
        As I hustled, I realized I didn’t want to just survive—I wanted to thrive.
        <br>
        <br>
        That’s when I found my true calling in marketing, a field where I could combine creativity, storytelling, and technical expertise. 
        <br>
        <br>
        From this passion, Adaminds was born.
        <br>
        <br>
        Today, I help e-commerce businesses craft digital experiences that captivate, engage, and drive meaningful growth.
        <br>
        <br>
        It’s been a wild ride so far!
        <br>
        <br>
        And I wouldn’t have it any other way, but maybe that's just me.
