      <p align="justify">
        Born and raised in Geneva, Switzerland, I grew up in a household shaped by diplomacy and diversity—as both my Guatemalan parents worked at the UN. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Little did I know that this upbringing would ignite an adventurous career journey full of bold pivots, steep learning curves, and an unrelenting passion for growth.
        <br>
        <br>
        It all started in the high-stakes world of commodity trading. While grateful for this incredible opportunity, the finance grind didn’t light the fire I was searching for.
        <br>
        <br>
        So, I took a leap and launched a cannabis startup. 
        The highs were exhilarating (no pun intended) and the lows were humbling. 
        I learned that startup life was anything but easy—a crash course in resilience and adaptability.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Realizing I needed to level up, I stepped into the consulting world. 
        My first stop was Capgemini as a Data Analyst, where I found myself knee-deep in legacy systems—feeling more like a data janitor than an analyst.
        Not exactly the thrilling career I envisioned.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then came OWT, a place buzzing with entrepreneurial energy. 
        I learned to think big, take calculated risks, and design strategies that actually worked—skills that continue to shape my work today.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I ventured into freelancing as a data scientist, I faced another eye-opener: technical expertise wasn’t enough. If I wanted to succeed, I had to master the art of selling.
        <br>
        <br>
        That realization, coupled with my clients needs, led me to marketing, a field where I could blend creativity, storytelling, and technical expertise.
        <br>
        <br>
        I launched a marketing science agency called Adaminds, and suddenly, I felt like I had found my true calling.
        <br>
        <br>
        All my previous experiences seemed to align, connecting like pieces of a puzzle.
        <br>
        <br>
        Today, I help e-commerce businesses craft digital experiences that captivate, engage, and drive meaningful growth.
        <br>
        <br>
        It’s been a wild ride filled with tears, blood and sweat, but also ecstatic moments of joy.
        <br>
        <br>
        And honestly? I wouldn’t have it any other way.
