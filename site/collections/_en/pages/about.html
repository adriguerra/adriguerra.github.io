      <p align="justify">
        Born and raised in Geneva, Switzerland, I grew up in a home shaped by diplomacy and diversity, as both my Guatemalan parents worked at the United Nations.
        <br>
        <br>
        Little did I know this upbringing would spark a career filled with bold turns, steep learning curves, and an unrelenting passion for growth.
        <br>
        <br>
        It all started in the high-stakes world of commodity trading. While grateful for the incredible opportunity to work at <a href="https://www.kochinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Koch</a>, the financial routine didn’t ignite the spark I was looking for.
        <br>
        <br>
        So I took a leap and launched a cannabis startup.
        The highs were thrilling (pun intended), and the lows were humbling.
        I learned that startup life was anything but easy—a lesson in resilience and adaptability.
        <br>
        <br>
        Realizing I needed to level up, I ventured into the world of consulting.
        My first stop was <a href="https://capgemini.ch" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Capgemini</a> as a Data Analyst, where I found myself immersed in legacy systems, feeling more like a "data cleaner" than an analyst.
        It wasn’t exactly the exciting career I had envisioned.
        <br>
        <br>
        Then came <a href="https://owt.swiss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OWT</a>, a place brimming with entrepreneurial energy.
        I learned to think big, take calculated risks, and craft strategies that actually worked—skills that continue to shape my work today.
        <br>
        <br>
        When I ventured into freelancing as a data scientist, I faced another revelation: technical expertise alone wasn’t enough. If I wanted to succeed, I had to master the art of selling.
        <br>
        <br>
        That realization, along with my clients’ needs, led me to marketing—a field where I could combine creativity, storytelling, and technical expertise.
        <br>
        <br>
        I launched a marketing science agency called Adaminds, and suddenly, I felt like I had found my true calling.
        <br>
        <br>
        All my previous experiences seemed to align, connecting like pieces of a puzzle.
        <br>
        <br>
        Today, I help e-commerce businesses create digital experiences that captivate, engage, and drive meaningful growth.
        <br>
        <br>
        It’s been a wild ride full of blood, sweat, and tears—but also moments of ecstatic joy.
        <br>
        <br>
        And the truth? I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
