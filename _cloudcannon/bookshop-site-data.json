X being courage, piety, justice, temperance or wisdom. The protagonists give him instances of these abstracts words as they try to come up with a definition. But Socrates rejects all of them; he always finds a use of the word which does not fit the given definition.</p>\n\n<p>In Euthyphro, for instance, Socrates and Euthyphro attempt to establish a definitive meaning for the word piety. Socrates asks: <em>“What is piety?”</em>, to which Euthyphro replies that piety is what he is doing right now. Socrates rejects this definition, because Euthyphro’s action is merely an example and does not provide the essential characteristic that make pious actions pious. Euthyphro attempts to give four further definitions, but Socrates keeps questioning them (known as the <strong>Socratic questioning</strong> or <strong>Socratic method</strong>). Euthyphro ends up running out of patience and leaves Socrates without a clear definition of piety.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*JvZwMoSu7ABRDgQU\" alt=\"Euthyphro\" /></p>\n\n<p>Socrates was seeking a common nature amongst the instances given to him to find a real definition. He believed the common nature justified the use of the common name, that it was unethical to use words if their meaning wasn’t truly known. For instance, one could only be just if one knew the underlying common nature in justice. But neither Socrates nor any of the protagonists of the Socratic dialogues ever manage to find true definitions. The unfinished work suggested philosophy still had much progress to make. In any case, Socrates believed that being aware of his ignorance made him wiser than those who, though ignorant, still claimed knowledge.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I know that I know nothing.”</p>\n\n  <p>the Socratic paradox</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Centuries later, Ludwig Wittgenstein would attempt to resume Socrates’ unfinished work. He believed, however, that the people’s approach to give instances of words was right.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I can characterize my standpoint no better than by saying that it is the antithetical standpoint to the one occupied by Socrates in the Platonic dialogues. For if I were asked what knowledge is, I would enumerate instances of knowledge and add the words ‘and similar things’. There is no shared constituent to be discovered since none exists.”</p>\n\n  <p>Voices of Wittgenstein, Waismann &amp; Wittgenstein, 2003, p. 33</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*z-u5VJtjCSKd2xiL.webp\" alt=\"Wittgenstein\" /></p>\n\n<p>In Philosophical Investigations, he considers instances of the word game to illustrate his point.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Consider for example the proceedings that we call “games”. I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? Don’t say: “There must be something common, or they would not be called ‘games’” — but look and see whether there is anything common to all. — For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don’t think, but look!”</p>\n\n  <p>Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 31</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein suggests to look instead of to think, and to describe instead of to explain. Thinking is an abstract process subject to the mind’s corrupted point of view, while looking is practical and avoids this bias. Wittgenstein argued that things, which could be thought to be connected by one essential common feature, may in fact be connected by a series of overlapping similarities, where no one feature is common to all of the things. He coined this concept <strong>family resemblance</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than “family resemblances”;… And I shall say: ‘games’ form a family.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 32</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein didn’t think that words corresponded to things. The function and the meaning of a word were determined by its use. Definition is not something prior to the use of a word that fixes its meaning and determines how it will be used, but rather a descriptive tool that reflects the various ways a word is used:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screwdriver, a rule, a glue-pot, nails and screws. — The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects.”</p>\n\n  <p>Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 6</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein saw language merely as a tool used to accomplish everyday goals and activities, which essentially determine a word’s meaning. He called these activities <strong>language-games</strong>, because the rules of language were like the rules of a game, and saying something was like making a move in a game.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Here the term “language-game” is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.”</p>\n\n  <p>Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 11</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While our brains naturally associate pictures to words, even when thinking of abstract ones like justice or soul, words in reality don’t tell us anything about the true nature of the thing they represent. Wittgenstein’s main point was to escape from our mental images when dealing with philosophy because everyone had a different image that clouds reality.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably.”</p>\n\n  <p>Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 48</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, even if one could find an essential definition of a word, this would not undermine Wittgenstein’s argument. Wittgenstein isn’t necessarily against definitions, because in many cases essential definitions do exist and are even needed, typically in scientific contexts. But he just does not think all words must have an essential definition, so he suggests the concept of family resemblance. This raises the question: <em>How can we know which terms have essential definitions and which do not?</em> Wittgenstein’s claim makes defining a concept easier by lowering the expectations of what is required, but the challenge is to remain precise.</p>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein valued clarity more than universal truth, which really made him stand out as a philosopher. Philosophers generally ask why to uncover hidden truths and consider that this is the most profound they can do. Wittgenstein, on the other hand, deemed looking as much profounder and saw it as a great difficulty because one must learn to ignore many preconceptions that cloud our judgment. Wittgenstein claiming that there is no shared constituent in knowledge would typically be reprimanded by most philosophers, particularly Socrates, because he gives up in the search for truth. While Wittgenstein does give valid answers to many of philosophy’s questions, he also inevitably raises further questions, like which terms have essential definitions and which do not. Much like in Socrates’ case, there is still work left to do in this regard. But in response to many of his critics, Wittgenstein would say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“The mystical is not how the world is, but that it is.”</p>\n\n  <p>Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 1922</p>\n</blockquote>\n","url":"/blog/wittgenstein","relative_path":"_posts/2020-04-14-wittgenstein.markdown","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","date":"2021-01-28 00:00:00 -0600","title":"7 Lessons from a Student-Entrepreneur","description":"7 valuable lessons to help other student-entrepreneurs move forward with their goals and ambitions.","tags":["career","entrepreneurship"],"image":"/images/woods_antoinebruy.jpg","slug":"7-lessons","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p><em>This article is for student-entrepreneurs eager to getting their startup off-the-ground.

I spent more than a year working on a startup project as a student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). I learned some valuable lessons that I hope can help other entrepreneurial-minded students move forward with their goals and ambitions.</em></p>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurship always starts with an idea. But ideas don’t matter as much as we think initially. The sustained effort put in, the lessons from your journey, and ultimately, the lessons about you matter much more.</p>\n\n<p>Launching a startup is a major initiative. More so, if it involves refusing or quitting a job. When I was starting, I was focused on having my ideas come to fruition. I didn’t really know what I was getting myself into — thank goodness, because I wouldn’t have done it otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurship is one hell of a ride. A startup is a lot more than just ideas. A clear vision is crucial, in order to recruit a diverse team of A-players. But only by constantly putting yourself on the frontline, taking on responsibilities and showing the way forward, do you fully gain your team’s trust and confidence.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some key lessons from my experience as a student-entrepreneur:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-embrace-failure\">1. Embrace failure.</h2>\n<p>You’re going to fail. But it’s okay, because failing is part of life.</p>\n\n<p>Elon Musk, one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our generation, said he thought SpaceX and Tesla would fail, but he was perfectly okay with that. When people asked me about the risks of failure, I would say that if I failed, I would happily go live in nature.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to think like an entrepreneur, be prepared to fail. I came across a team of brilliant student-entrepreneurs who worked really hard on their project for far too long. They ended up disgusted by entrepreneurship when they decided to pull the plug. A shame, really, because startups are meant to be fun. Far too often, we hear epic stories of entrepreneurs who manage to pull out a win when things seem bleak, but we rarely hear about the countless others who don’t. When your startup has lost traction, admitting failure is probably one of the hardest but best things to do.</p>\n\n<p>Embrace failure. You will admit defeat more easily when your startup is sinking. More importantly: you will try more, you will learn more and you will achieve more.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-communicate\">2. Communicate.</h2>\n<p>If you’re launching a startup, you want to spread the word out as much as possible because you never know who might provide you with crucial help down the road.</p>\n\n<p>When adding team members, be aware that your team’s success depends on good communication throughout your startup. Not only do additional team members create significant communication overhead (see Brook’s Law below), but they can also pose a risk if that person does not fit in with the culture of the startup.</p>\n\n<p>Brooks’ Law: a large team size represents significant overhead in terms of communication.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pLdfse5oA5nJOEjemvmgig.webp\" alt=\"Communication lines\" /></p>\n\n<p>Treat your team like your family: you work for them, they don’t work for you. Be prepared to adapt to your team’s needs, and make sure that the people that you let in have both the capacity and the personality to work in a startup. One toxic person can be enough to ruin the fun. Losing team members is one of the worst things that can happen to a startup, because the workforce is so small.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"3-dont-think-act\">3. Don’t think, act.</h2>\n<p>Overthinking is a classic time-wasting issue of inexperienced entrepreneurs. Avoid analysis paralysis by simplifying matters at hand. In this sense, recognising one-way and two-way door decisions can help.</p>\n\n<p>One-way door decisions are decisions that you can’t easily reverse. These need to be done methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. Two-way door decisions, on the other hand, can be reversed. You can walk through the door, see if you like it, and if not go back. These decisions should be automated or delegated. Most decisions are two-way door decisions, so learn to make these as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, seek to develop habits that allow you to act and reflect effectively, while getting rid of bad ones too. Learn to say no, in order to focus on what you say yes to.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"4-listen-carefully\">4. Listen carefully.</h2>\n<p>Just because you’re leading a startup, that doesn’t mean you’re always right.</p>\n\n<p>Listen carefully to everyone around you: your team, your clients, your partners, your friends. Surround yourself with people who think differently. Encourage team members to generate and brainstorm new ideas. Cherish hearing things that make you feel uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p>Talk to clients. Put yourself in other people’s shoes. Learn to think about what you’re not thinking about. The truth may hurt, but a lack of truth will hurt even more in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t fall in the trap of blindly following what other people say. Everyone likes to think they know a few things about business. Learn to notice people who speak out of vanity — they’re probably not the ones you should be following advice from or even arguing with. Read people from their emotions, rather than their words.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, you must form your own opinions. Use the collective brain power of people around you to do most of the thinking — you’re just orchestrating.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"5-trust-yourself\">5. Trust yourself.</h2>\n<p>Seek steady progress, rather than unrealistic ambitious goals.</p>\n\n<p>There will always be things that you can’t control. When goals or expectations aren’t reached, keep an objective view to content yourself with steady progress. Don’t be too hard on yourself and on others — everyone is doing their best. Do it for long enough and eventually you will hit the lottery. Everyone gets lucky sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>The definition of success is also highly subjective. Ultimately, the only one who can judge whether you’re being successful or not, is you. Believe in yourself. You’re capable of being whoever you set yourself out to be. Dream. Have faith.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, leaders must have enough character to build trust. Without trust, you have no followers. Without followers, who do you lead? Start by trusting yourself. You will trust others more easily and others will trust you more too.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"6-improve-your-relationships\">6. Improve your relationships.</h2>\n<p>Seek to improve your relationships, starting with the ones closest to you. When I started off my entrepreneurial journey, not only was I taking somewhat of a risk, I wanted to launch a cannabis startup. You can imagine that my parents weren’t totally up for it.</p>\n\n<p>The road of a startup is long, you need to rely on other people’s enthusiasm to keep going. Get family and friends on board with your vision. Not only will it provide you with precious moral support, but more people will want to help you.</p>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurship is like sports. When you lose, you have to be the first one back on your feet encouraging team members to continue, no matter how hard of a blow you may just have gone through. When things are bad, don’t give up. When things are great, be realistic.</p>\n\n<p>Improving all of your relationships will help you lead with more empathy and spread positivity in your startup. Everyone will enjoy the ride a lot more.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"7-know-yourself\">7. Know yourself.</h2>\n<p>Some philosophical questions you should constantly ask yourself throughout your journey:</p>\n\n<p>Who are you?\nWhy do you do what you do?\nWhat’s the change that you would like to see in the world?\nPhilosophy acts like a moral compass. Inquiring into your understanding of reality, knowledge, and how you should live will provide you with principles that can help you never feel lost in life again.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Science is what you know. Philosophy is what you don’t know.”</p>\n\n  <p>Bertrand Russell</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regularly put time aside to relax and reflect. Build your character. Remember, you’re playing the long game, so strive to stay healthy in the long run. Calming your mind down will boost your creativity. My best ideas come while relaxing, not when I am desperately looking for them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>To summarise, focus on yourself and the rest will follow. Sometimes you may have to be patient, but hard work pays off.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the lessons that I learned, as well as several habits that I adopted, were inspired by Stoicism. Stoic principles provide useful and practical ways to find tranquility and improve one’s strengths of character. Some of the greatest leaders in history have followed Stoic philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, theory is never enough. Practice is just as important, because in the words of a great Stoic philosopher:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“That’s why the philosophers warn us not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then training. For as time passes, we forget what we learned and end up doing the opposite, and hold opinions the opposite of what we should.”</p>\n\n  <p>Epictetus</p>\n</blockquote>\n","url":"/blog/7-lessons","relative_path":"_posts/2021-01-28-7-lessons.markdown","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","date":"2021-09-15 00:00:00 -0500","title":"Fail fast, learn faster.","description":"After trying to launch a startup, I kneel down and surrender my sword to begin looking at new career opportunities.","tags":["career","entrepreneurship"],"image":"/images/knight_surrender.jpg","slug":"fail-fast-learn-faster","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p><em>Two years after taking the initiative of launching a startup, I kneel down and surrender my sword to begin looking at new career opportunities.

The ride was crazy. Ecstatic moments repeatedly turned into emotional wreckages, only for new impulses to push me forward again. Despite the final outcome, the lessons were invaluable. Today, I feel more resilient than ever to face the next challenges that life will throw at me.</em></p>\n\n<p>While following my Master’s at EPFL, I realized how lucky I was to have a startup ecosystem that offered support to entrepreneurial students. University really seemed like the best time to launch a startup. It also motivated me for my studies: I didn’t simply want to get them over with anymore, I wanted to enjoy the experience and stick around a little longer.</p>\n\n<p>Naivety, curiosity and a strong desire to express my creativity pushed me toward entrepreneurship. The class of actions that followed made me grow in ways I couldn’t have possibly imagined. Taking on responsibilities, communicating regularly and trusting the right people were skills that I couldn’t have developed in a classroom or through a textbook. Had I known how difficult the entrepreneurial path would be, I would have never pursued it in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>I started brainstorming several ideas, but eventually settled for the Vivino of CBD. My dad was becoming quite a wine expert thanks to Vivino, while a friend was set to start a job at a CBD business. I tried CBD for sleep, stress, muscle pain and even as part of my spiritual practices. I discovered how much science there was to the cannabis plant, but how little was being presented to the public.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*RapTk4VMeNkn3yNC\" alt=\"CBD\" /></p>\n\n<p>University peers recommended me a startup course given by the Swiss Innovation Agency. Participants had to pitch their idea hoping to work on it throughout the course. Selected projects would have the opportunity to recruit team members and have coaches regularly provide them feedback. One of which would become my mentor and business partner: Haider Alleg.</p>\n\n<p>But things could have gone very differently from the start. Haider missed the round of introduction between the coaches and the startups. A couple of weeks later, I received a long thread of emails between Haider and another coach. Haider had been trying to reach me, but the messages had ended up in the wrong mailbox.</p>\n\n<p>When we finally managed to schedule our first in-person meeting, he came over an hour late. I entered our meeting annoyed, but came out amazed by the momentum he was already giving us. He sent me a duplicate of his Wordpress website for a similar project, which he had invested time and money in. It needed some tweaking, but within a week we could have our minimum viable product.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the excitement didn’t last. Coursework, project deadlines and final year exams were taking more time than expected. On top of that, my team wasn’t helping as much as I would have hoped for. I felt overwhelmed.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, Haider’s input kept us going. His advice was so valuable that sometimes it took me months to realize things he had been saying all along. When the course came to an end, my teammates left the project. Haider couldn’t imagine me going forward with no team and no money.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I didn’t feel like it was time to give up just yet. I started reaching out to friends I thought might be interested by the project. Once I had recruited my first couple of team members, the tables turned: people were coming to me to offer help. We entered our best-ever-yet honeymoon phase. Launching a startup was fun!</p>\n\n<p>Everything was hugs and kisses until one day, my friend who wrote blog articles told me that he was quitting. I was devastated, but wasted little time in looking for new potential recruits.</p>\n\n<p>I was discussing terms with a new co-founder, when Haider called. He had a new project for me. His friend had developed an agricultural commodity trading platform, and was looking to deploy it in new industries such as cannabis. At first, I was hesitant. How could I let go of everything achieved in the past year. After seeing the platform, it became clearer that this project required my full uncontested attention.</p>\n\n<p>I called the previous project off and started dedicating myself to the new one. We had meetings every week. I was the most junior of the three, so every meeting was incredibly stimulating— I was learning so much!</p>\n\n<p>Fast-forward to 10 months later, and a mix of circumstances — including a lack of experience on my side — made us lose traction. Team dynamics weren’t on track anymore and eventually, we agreed that the best solution was to part ways.</p>\n\n<p>Weirdly enough, pulling the plug the second time was far easier than the first. I was happy to notice a reduction in the half-life of my emotions, key to move on in life.</p>\n\n<p>I feel extremely fortunate to have had an experience that I will carry on learning from for years to come. A massive thank you goes to everyone that I met along the way. Especially my parents for their unconditional support. None of this would have been possible without them.</p>\n\n<p>And remember: <em>fail fast, learn faster.</em></p>\n","url":"/blog/fail-fast-learn-faster","relative_path":"_posts/2021-09-15-fail-fast-learn-faster.markdown","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","date":"2023-03-01 00:00:00 -0600","title":"Finding my path","image":"/images/path.jpg","description":"Hold on tight, because life is a rollercoaster.

Try to enjoy the ride though, it’s actually pretty fun!</em></p>\n\n<p>I began my career by getting fired from my own startup project. Far from discouraging me, it gave me strength and clarity to tackle new challenges.</p>\n\n<p>After a period of burning cash, I needed to find a way to generate a steady income while gaining experience to launch my own business one day.</p>\n\n<p>Consulting seemed to respond best to those needs. My entourage, however, did not seem as enthusiastic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“You don’t start a career in consulting.”</p>\n\n  <p>“Engineers who work in consulting waste their potential.”</p>\n\n  <p>“Consulting is hard work. Can you handle it?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moreover, my initial consulting experience had been quite hectic, to say the least.</p>\n\n<p>After graduating from EPFL, my startup mentor hired me for a consulting gig. He, his client, and I met for a drink one afternoon to discuss a project. We established deadlines, defined a scope, and off I was to begin my summer project.</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks in, my mentor disappeared without any prior notice. He went on holiday and completely disconnected for nearly a month. Unexpectedly, I was left to handle the client on my own.</p>\n\n<p>The client was eager to disrupt the real estate industry with technology, while I was more focused on meeting expectations. I felt my job hanging by a thread, but I managed to deliver a report detailing realty pricing models that would be subsequently put to use.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks after getting that load off my back, my startup crashed. My last 2 years were gone in the blink of an eye. Fortunately, my university career fair was just around the corner. Out on the market with a failed startup story to tell, every company wanted to hire me.</p>\n\n<p>Skipping over several rounds of interviews, I joined Capgemini’s Insights and Data practice as a Data Analyst. A brand new team consisting of fresh consultants eager for success, led by a distinguished and experienced consultant. We were determined to attack the Swiss market, which was ripe for digitalization after the pandemic. On paper, the project seemed exciting, but in reality, it was destined for disaster. I wasn’t enjoying my experience there, so I left soon after.</p>\n\n<p>During the career fair, I was also in touch with Open Web Technology, a smaller yet reputable consulting firm. Although my head led me towards Capgemini, my heart always pumped for Open Web. The on-site interview had left a great impression on me: they were a small family of entrepreneurs sharing a similar background to mine. After leaving Capgemini, I knew where I wanted to be.</p>\n\n<p>The job did not disappoint. A few months in, I truly believed that I had found my dream job. I was learning a great deal, team events were fun, and, unlike before, my voice was heard.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, I began taking on more and more responsibilities. With the onset of cold winter days, however, I started feeling overwhelmed. “Had I taken on too much too quickly?” I wondered. Everything was happening so fast, I had no time to pause and reflect. As we were delivering my biggest project yet, I took some time off and realized that the company and I were no longer aligned. I wasn’t growing the way I wanted to, so I quit shortly thereafter.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, I learned some important lessons from my experiences:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A larger company does not necessarily mean it is better for you. As companies grow, they become less prone to taking risks. Their focus shifts toward maintaining profits and market share. Ideally, you should find a company that you can grow with.</li>\n  <li>My generation is used to quick wins and quick rewards (thank you smartphones). When we don’t receive them promptly, we become disappointed. This is important to keep in mind because building trust takes time. Based on my experiences, it takes even longer with older generations.</li>\n  <li>Going through several rounds of interviews is actually beneficial. You get to meet more people and get a better sense of the job. This will give you a better idea of what to expect once you start working.</li>\n  <li>When you start a new job, you’re not starting over — you’re starting from experience. Your experience is what sets you apart from everyone else.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Life is a journey. The destination doesn’t matter as much as the experiences along the way. For me, that journey is only just beginning.</p>\n","url":"/blog/finding-my-path","relative_path":"_posts/2023-03-01-finding-my-path.markdown","permalink":null},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","date":"2023-05-02 00:00:00 -0500","title":"How yoga has made me a better human being","description":"Yoga has instilled values of mindfulness, compassion, and unity, and inspired me to embody and share these principles with everyone I encounter.","tags":["travel","life","story"],"image":"/images/post-4.jpg","slug":"ytt","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p>Yoga is the union of mind, body, and spirit.

Surrounded by a nurturing environment at the Mystical Yoga Farm, I found myself in a space where every chant, every ceremony, and every cacao session was a step towards deeper self-understanding.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most beautiful aspects of this experience was the strong sense of community. I met  incredible souls, each enriching the experience in their unique way. We bonded over yoga sessions, dances, temazcales (sweat lodge ceremonies), lake swims, and countless cuddle puddles. These moments fostered relationships that transcended typical friendship boundaries, forming a family connected by a shared journey of growth and healing.</p>\n\n<p>Our shared experience at the farm demonstrated the power of collective energy for healing and transformation. Each activity was part of a broader process that gradually helped me grow and heal. We established a safe environment where everyone could freely express themselves, reminding us of life’s true essence: love.</p>\n\n<p>I firmly believe that intentional communities, such as the one that I lived in, are where our future visionaries will emerge. My one-month stay in this community profoundly influenced my outlook on life and society. The values of mindfulness, compassion, and unity that I learned extend beyond the yoga mat to all aspects of life.</p>\n\n<p>As I step into the role of a yoga teacher, my aim is to embody and share these values. It’s not just about being able to teach Hatha and Vinyasa classes this summer, but also about living a life that reflects the profound lessons learned through this training.</p>\n","url":"/blog/ytt","relative_path":"_posts/2023-05-02-ytt.markdown","permalink":null}],"pages":[{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","title":"About","content_blocks":[{"_bookshop_name":"page-heading","title":"About","description":null},{"_bookshop_name":"page-image","image":"/images/page-1.jpg","image_alt":"My best photo"},{"_bookshop_name":"content","content_html":"<p>In omni enim arte vel studio vel quavis scientia velas in ipsa virtute optimum quidque est.
