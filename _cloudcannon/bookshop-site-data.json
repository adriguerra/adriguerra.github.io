The allure of doing something unique and pioneering motivated me to launch a cannabis startup in Switzerland.\n  I immersed myself in Switzerland's entrepreneurial ecosystem, expanding my network and familiarizing myself with the country's innovation landscape.\n  Starting a business here proved to be <a href=\"/blog/fail-fast-learn-faster\"> full of twists and turns</a>, much like navigating a mountain pass, but the exhilarating highs (no pun intended) undoubtedly made the journey worthwhile.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Eager to maintain my entrepreneurial momentum, I became part of Capgemini's latest initiative: the data squad. \n  I envisioned myself embarking on an adventure akin to a digital James Bond mission.\n  However, I soon realized that our \"super cool\" project was essentially becoming the janitors of the digital world, tasked with tidying up the chaotic data messes of mega-corporations in legacy software systems.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Craving a break from my role as the go-to tech minion for the corporate overlords, I wanted a taste of the business and strategy world. \n  That's when I stumbled into OWT, a place where Switzerland's finest entrepreneurs sharpened their pencils (and minds). \n  At OWT, I felt like I was living a dream, crafting exquisite products from mere thoughts to tangible triumphs.\n  I threw myself into the work with the passion of a love-struck teenager.\n  But like all whirlwind romances, I eventually hit the <a href=\"/blog/finding-my-path\">burnout wall</a>. \n  Torn to bits as if I had broken up with my highschool sweetheart, I left everything to travel around the world.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n</p>\n  <h2>Why Freelancing</h2>\n  <p align=\"justify\">\n    After a break from the complex landscapes of large corporations and institutions, I transitioned into freelancing with enthusiasm. \n    Embarking on this journey became necessary to embrace the freedom of achieving a harmonious balance across various facets of my life. \n    I found in freelancing not just unmatched flexibility but a profound opportunity to tackle diverse projects around the globe, each presenting its distinct objectives, resonating deeply with my personal identity and life's mission.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    My data freelancing journey has allowed me to blend professional flexibility with personal development and cultural exchange. \n    Embracing diverse global projects enriches both my professional expertise and personal growth, creating a dynamic interplay between the work I do and the life I lead.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    But my professional aspirations are just one facet of my freelancing journey. \n    Equally important is the freedom acquired to nurture other areas of my life, such as <a href=\"/blog/yoga\">practicing yoga</a> and exploring music. \n    These are not mere hobbies but essential components of my well-being and personal growth, enabling me to evolve in a more rounded and holistic manner.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Moreover, my journey is deeply rooted in a commitment to fostering a sustainable future for our society and planet. \n    My endeavors, both personal and professional, are driven by a vision of achieving harmony between humanity and nature—a vision where this balance is not merely an aspiration but a tangible reality.\n</p>

X being courage, piety, justice, temperance or wisdom. The protagonists give him instances of these abstracts words as they try to come up with a definition. But Socrates rejects all of them; he always finds a use of the word which does not fit the given definition.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/images/socrates.jpg\" alt=\"Socrates\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"image-caption\"><em>Socrates c. 470–399 BC</em></p>\n\n<p>In Euthyphro, for instance, Socrates and Euthyphro attempt to establish a definitive meaning for the word piety. Socrates asks: <em>“What is piety?”</em>, to which Euthyphro replies that piety is what he is doing right now. Socrates rejects this definition, because Euthyphro’s action is merely an example and does not provide the essential characteristic that make pious actions pious. Euthyphro attempts to give four further definitions, but Socrates keeps questioning them (known as the <strong>Socratic questioning</strong> or <strong>Socratic method</strong>). Euthyphro ends up running out of patience and leaves Socrates without a clear definition of piety.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*JvZwMoSu7ABRDgQU\" alt=\"Euthyphro\" /></p>\n\n<p>Socrates was seeking a common nature amongst the instances given to him to find a real definition. He believed the common nature justified the use of the common name, that it was unethical to use words if their meaning wasn’t truly known. For instance, one could only be just if one knew the underlying common nature in justice. But neither Socrates nor any of the protagonists of the Socratic dialogues ever manage to find true definitions. The unfinished work suggested philosophy still had much progress to make. In any case, Socrates believed that being aware of his ignorance made him wiser than those who, though ignorant, still claimed knowledge.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>I know that I know nothing.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>the Socratic paradox</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Centuries later, Ludwig Wittgenstein would attempt to resume Socrates’ unfinished work. He believed, however, that the people’s approach to give instances of words was right.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>I can characterize my standpoint no better than by saying that it is the antithetical standpoint to the one occupied by Socrates in the Platonic dialogues. For if I were asked what knowledge is, I would enumerate instances of knowledge and add the words ‘and similar things’. There is no shared constituent to be discovered since none exists.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Voices of Wittgenstein, Waismann &amp; Wittgenstein, 2003, p. 33</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*z-u5VJtjCSKd2xiL.webp\" alt=\"Wittgenstein\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"image-caption\"><em>Ludwig Wittgenstein 1889–1951</em></p>\n\n<p>In Philosophical Investigations, he considers instances of the word game to illustrate his point.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Consider for example the proceedings that we call “games”. I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? Don’t say: “There must be something common, or they would not be called ‘games’” — but look and see whether there is anything common to all. — For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don’t think, but look!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 31</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein suggests to look instead of to think, and to describe instead of to explain. Thinking is an abstract process subject to the mind’s corrupted point of view, while looking is practical and avoids this bias. Wittgenstein argued that things, which could be thought to be connected by one essential common feature, may in fact be connected by a series of overlapping similarities, where no one feature is common to all of the things. He coined this concept <strong>family resemblance</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>I can think of no better expression to characterize these similarities than “family resemblances”;… And I shall say: ‘games’ form a family.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 32</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein didn’t think that words corresponded to things. The function and the meaning of a word were determined by its use. Definition is not something prior to the use of a word that fixes its meaning and determines how it will be used, but rather a descriptive tool that reflects the various ways a word is used:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screwdriver, a rule, a glue-pot, nails and screws. — The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 6</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein saw language merely as a tool used to accomplish everyday goals and activities, which essentially determine a word’s meaning. He called these activities <strong>language-games</strong>, because the rules of language were like the rules of a game, and saying something was like making a move in a game.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Here the term “language-game” is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 11</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While our brains naturally associate pictures to words, even when thinking of abstract ones like justice or soul, words in reality don’t tell us anything about the true nature of the thing they represent. Wittgenstein’s main point was to escape from our mental images when dealing with philosophy because everyone had a different image that clouds reality.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 48</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, even if one could find an essential definition of a word, this would not undermine Wittgenstein’s argument. Wittgenstein isn’t necessarily against definitions, because in many cases essential definitions do exist and are even needed, typically in scientific contexts. But he just does not think all words must have an essential definition, so he suggests the concept of family resemblance. This raises the question: <em>How can we know which terms have essential definitions and which do not?</em> Wittgenstein’s claim makes defining a concept easier by lowering the expectations of what is required, but the challenge is to remain precise.</p>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein valued clarity more than universal truth, which really made him stand out as a philosopher. Philosophers generally ask why to uncover hidden truths and consider that this is the most profound they can do. Wittgenstein, on the other hand, deemed looking as much profounder and saw it as a great difficulty because one must learn to ignore many preconceptions that cloud our judgment. Wittgenstein claiming that there is no shared constituent in knowledge would typically be reprimanded by most philosophers, particularly Socrates, because he gives up in the search for truth. While Wittgenstein does give valid answers to many of philosophy’s questions, he also inevitably raises further questions, like which terms have essential definitions and which do not. Much like in Socrates’ case, there is still work left to do in this regard. But in response to many of his critics, Wittgenstein would say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>The mystical is not how the world is, but that it is.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 1922</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n","url":"/blog/wittgenstein","relative_path":"_en/posts/2020-04-14-wittgenstein.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","permalink":"/blog/:slug","date":"2021-01-28 00:00:00 -0600","title":"7 Lessons for Student-Entrepreneurs","description":"7 valuable lessons to help other student-entrepreneurs move forward with their goals and ambitions.","tags":["career","entrepreneurship"],"image":"/images/woods_antoinebruy.jpg","slug":"7-lessons","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p><em>This article is for student-entrepreneurs eager to getting their startup off-the-ground.

I spent more than a year working on a startup project as a student at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL). I learned some valuable lessons that I hope can help other entrepreneurial-minded students move forward with their goals and ambitions.</em></p>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurship always starts with an idea. But ideas don’t matter as much as we think initially. The sustained effort put in, the lessons from your journey, and ultimately, the lessons about you matter much more.</p>\n\n<p>Launching a startup is a major initiative. More so, if it involves refusing or quitting a job. When I was starting, I was focused on having my ideas come to fruition. I didn’t really know what I was getting myself into — thank goodness, because I wouldn’t have done it otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurship is one hell of a ride. A startup is a lot more than just ideas. A clear vision is crucial, in order to recruit a diverse team of A-players. But only by constantly putting yourself on the frontline, taking on responsibilities and showing the way forward, do you fully gain your team’s trust and confidence.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some key lessons from my experience as a student-entrepreneur:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-embrace-failure\">1. Embrace failure.</h2>\n<p>You’re going to fail. But it’s okay, because failing is part of life.</p>\n\n<p>Elon Musk, one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our generation, said he thought SpaceX and Tesla would fail, but he was perfectly okay with that. When people asked me about the risks of failure, I would say that if I failed, I would happily go live in nature.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to think like an entrepreneur, be prepared to fail. I came across a team of brilliant student-entrepreneurs who worked really hard on their project for far too long. They ended up disgusted by entrepreneurship when they decided to pull the plug. A shame, really, because startups are meant to be fun. Far too often, we hear epic stories of entrepreneurs who manage to pull out a win when things seem bleak, but we rarely hear about the countless others who don’t. When your startup has lost traction, admitting failure is probably one of the hardest but best things to do.</p>\n\n<p>Embrace failure. You will admit defeat more easily when your startup is sinking. More importantly: you will try more, you will learn more and you will achieve more.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-communicate\">2. Communicate.</h2>\n<p>If you’re launching a startup, you want to spread the word out as much as possible because you never know who might provide you with crucial help down the road.</p>\n\n<p>When adding team members, be aware that your team’s success depends on good communication throughout your startup. Not only do additional team members create significant communication overhead (see Brook’s Law below), but they can also pose a risk if that person does not fit in with the culture of the startup.</p>\n\n<p>Brooks’ Law: a large team size represents significant overhead in terms of communication.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pLdfse5oA5nJOEjemvmgig.webp\" alt=\"Communication lines\" /></p>\n\n<p>Treat your team like your family: you work for them, they don’t work for you. Be prepared to adapt to your team’s needs, and make sure that the people that you let in have both the capacity and the personality to work in a startup. One toxic person can be enough to ruin the fun. Losing team members is one of the worst things that can happen to a startup, because the workforce is so small.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"3-dont-think-act\">3. Don’t think, act.</h2>\n<p>Overthinking is a classic time-wasting issue of inexperienced entrepreneurs. Avoid analysis paralysis by simplifying matters at hand. In this sense, recognising one-way and two-way door decisions can help.</p>\n\n<p>One-way door decisions are decisions that you can’t easily reverse. These need to be done methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. Two-way door decisions, on the other hand, can be reversed. You can walk through the door, see if you like it, and if not go back. These decisions should be automated or delegated. Most decisions are two-way door decisions, so learn to make these as quickly as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, seek to develop habits that allow you to act and reflect effectively, while getting rid of bad ones too. Learn to say no, in order to focus on what you say yes to.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"4-listen-carefully\">4. Listen carefully.</h2>\n<p>Just because you’re leading a startup, that doesn’t mean you’re always right.</p>\n\n<p>Listen carefully to everyone around you: your team, your clients, your partners, your friends. Surround yourself with people who think differently. Encourage team members to generate and brainstorm new ideas. Cherish hearing things that make you feel uncomfortable.</p>\n\n<p>Talk to clients. Put yourself in other people’s shoes. Learn to think about what you’re not thinking about. The truth may hurt, but a lack of truth will hurt even more in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t fall in the trap of blindly following what other people say. Everyone likes to think they know a few things about business. Learn to notice people who speak out of vanity — they’re probably not the ones you should be following advice from or even arguing with. Read people from their emotions, rather than their words.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, you must form your own opinions. Use the collective brain power of people around you to do most of the thinking — you’re just orchestrating.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"5-trust-yourself\">5. Trust yourself.</h2>\n<p>Seek steady progress, rather than unrealistic ambitious goals.</p>\n\n<p>There will always be things that you can’t control. When goals or expectations aren’t reached, keep an objective view to content yourself with steady progress. Don’t be too hard on yourself and on others — everyone is doing their best. Do it for long enough and eventually you will hit the lottery. Everyone gets lucky sometimes.</p>\n\n<p>The definition of success is also highly subjective. Ultimately, the only one who can judge whether you’re being successful or not, is you. Believe in yourself. You’re capable of being whoever you set yourself out to be. Dream. Have faith.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, leaders must have enough character to build trust. Without trust, you have no followers. Without followers, who do you lead? Start by trusting yourself. You will trust others more easily and others will trust you more too.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"6-improve-your-relationships\">6. Improve your relationships.</h2>\n<p>Seek to improve your relationships, starting with the ones closest to you. When I started off my entrepreneurial journey, not only was I taking somewhat of a risk, I wanted to launch a cannabis startup. You can imagine that my parents weren’t totally up for it.</p>\n\n<p>The road of a startup is long, you need to rely on other people’s enthusiasm to keep going. Get family and friends on board with your vision. Not only will it provide you with precious moral support, but more people will want to help you.</p>\n\n<p>Entrepreneurship is like sports. When you lose, you have to be the first one back on your feet encouraging team members to continue, no matter how hard of a blow you may just have gone through. When things are bad, don’t give up. When things are great, be realistic.</p>\n\n<p>Improving all of your relationships will help you lead with more empathy and spread positivity in your startup. Everyone will enjoy the ride a lot more.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"7-know-yourself\">7. Know yourself.</h2>\n<p>Some philosophical questions you should constantly ask yourself throughout your journey:</p>\n\n<p>Who are you?\nWhy do you do what you do?\nWhat’s the change that you would like to see in the world?\nPhilosophy acts like a moral compass. Inquiring into your understanding of reality, knowledge, and how you should live will provide you with principles that can help you never feel lost in life again.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Science is what you know. Philosophy is what you don’t know.”</p>\n\n  <p>Bertrand Russell</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regularly put time aside to relax and reflect. Build your character. Remember, you’re playing the long game, so strive to stay healthy in the long run. Calming your mind down will boost your creativity. My best ideas come while relaxing, not when I am desperately looking for them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"final-thoughts\">Final thoughts</h2>\n<p>To summarise, focus on yourself and the rest will follow. Sometimes you may have to be patient, but hard work pays off.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the lessons that I learned, as well as several habits that I adopted, were inspired by Stoicism. Stoic principles provide useful and practical ways to find tranquility and improve one’s strengths of character. Some of the greatest leaders in history have followed Stoic philosophy.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, theory is never enough. Practice is just as important, because in the words of a great Stoic philosopher:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“That’s why the philosophers warn us not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then training. For as time passes, we forget what we learned and end up doing the opposite, and hold opinions the opposite of what we should.”</p>\n\n  <p>Epictetus</p>\n</blockquote>\n","url":"/blog/7-lessons","relative_path":"_en/posts/2021-01-28-7-lessons.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"project","permalink":"/portfolio/:slug","date":"2021-03-01 00:00:00 -0600","title":"Social Sentiment Analysis of CBD Consumption","subtitle":"Natural Language Processing","image":"/images/hemp-oil.jpg","slug":"CBD","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<h3 id=\"problem\">Problem</h3>\n<p>Despite the rising popularity of Cannabidiol (CBD) products, there is a lack of conclusive scientific evidence regarding its health benefits.

This project underscores the potential of advanced NLP methods in mining social media data to track public sentiment and usage patterns related to health products like CBD. It highlights the importance of social media surveillance as a fast, convenient, and cost-effective method to complement traditional surveillance sources. The findings also suggest a need for more research and better public health communication regarding the effects and potential benefits of CBD consumption.</p>\n","url":"/portfolio/cbd","relative_path":"_en/projects/2021-03-01-CBD.md"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"project","permalink":"/portfolio/:slug","date":"2021-07-29 22:20:35 -0500","title":"Business Analysis for a Real Estate Price Prediction Application","subtitle":"Business Analysis","image":"/images/swiss_real_estate.jpg","slug":"ba-real-estate","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<h3 id=\"problem\">Problem</h3>\n<p>The real estate market in Switzerland is highly regulated and complex, making accurate property valuation challenging for real estate vendors.

Today, I feel more resilient than ever to face the next challenges that life will throw at me.</em></p>\n\n<p>While following my Master’s at EPFL, I realized how lucky I was to have a startup ecosystem that offered support to entrepreneurial students. University really seemed like the best time to launch a startup. It also motivated me for my studies: I didn’t simply want to get them over with anymore, I wanted to enjoy the experience and stick around a little longer.</p>\n\n<p>Naivety, curiosity and a strong desire to express my creativity pushed me toward entrepreneurship. The class of actions that followed made me grow in ways I couldn’t have possibly imagined. Taking on responsibilities, communicating regularly and trusting the right people were skills that I couldn’t have developed in a classroom or through a textbook. Had I known how difficult the entrepreneurial path would be, I would have never pursued it in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>I started brainstorming several ideas, but eventually settled for the Vivino of CBD. My dad was becoming quite a wine expert thanks to Vivino, while a friend was set to start a job at a CBD business. I tried CBD for sleep, stress, muscle pain and even as part of my spiritual practices. I discovered how much science there was to the cannabis plant, but how little was being presented to the public.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*RapTk4VMeNkn3yNC\" alt=\"CBD\" /></p>\n\n<p>University peers recommended me a startup course given by the Swiss Innovation Agency. Participants had to pitch their idea hoping to work on it throughout the course. Selected projects would have the opportunity to recruit team members and have coaches regularly provide them feedback. One of which would become my mentor and business partner: Haider Alleg.</p>\n\n<p>But things could have gone very differently from the start. Haider missed the round of introduction between the coaches and the startups. A couple of weeks later, I received a long thread of emails between Haider and another coach. Haider had been trying to reach me, but the messages had ended up in the wrong mailbox.</p>\n\n<p>When we finally managed to schedule our first in-person meeting, he came over an hour late. I entered our meeting annoyed, but came out amazed by the momentum he was already giving us. He sent me a duplicate of his Wordpress website for a similar project, which he had invested time and money in. It needed some tweaking, but within a week we could have our minimum viable product.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the excitement didn’t last. Coursework, project deadlines and final year exams were taking more time than expected. On top of that, my team wasn’t helping as much as I would have hoped for. I felt overwhelmed.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, Haider’s input kept us going. His advice was so valuable that sometimes it took me months to realize things he had been saying all along. When the course came to an end, my teammates left the project. Haider couldn’t imagine me going forward with no team and no money.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I didn’t feel like it was time to give up just yet. I started reaching out to friends I thought might be interested by the project. Once I had recruited my first couple of team members, the tables turned: people were coming to me to offer help. We entered our best-ever-yet honeymoon phase. Launching a startup was fun!</p>\n\n<p>Everything was hugs and kisses until one day, my friend who wrote blog articles told me that he was quitting. I was devastated, but wasted little time in looking for new potential recruits.</p>\n\n<p>I was discussing terms with a new co-founder, when Haider called. He had a new project for me. His friend had developed an agricultural commodity trading platform, and was looking to deploy it in new industries such as cannabis. At first, I was hesitant. How could I let go of everything achieved in the past year. After seeing the platform, it became clearer that this project required my full uncontested attention.</p>\n\n<p>I called the previous project off and started dedicating myself to the new one. We had meetings every week. I was the most junior of the three, so every meeting was incredibly stimulating— I was learning so much!</p>\n\n<p>Fast-forward to 10 months later, and a mix of circumstances — including a lack of experience on my side — made us lose traction. Team dynamics weren’t on track anymore and eventually, we agreed that the best solution was to part ways.</p>\n\n<p>Weirdly enough, pulling the plug the second time was far easier than the first. I was happy to notice a reduction in the half-life of my emotions, key to move on in life.</p>\n\n<p>I feel extremely fortunate to have had an experience that I will carry on learning from for years to come. A massive thank you goes to everyone that I met along the way. Especially my parents for their unconditional support. None of this would have been possible without them.</p>\n\n<p>And remember: <em>fail fast, learn faster.</em></p>\n","url":"/blog/fail-fast-learn-faster","relative_path":"_en/posts/2021-09-15-fail-fast-learn-faster.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"project","permalink":"/portfolio/:slug","date":"2022-01-14 22:20:35 -0600","title":"Automated Costs Allocation Based on Historical Inputs of Financial Controllers","subtitle":"Machine Learning","image":"/images/semiconductor.jpg","slug":"semiconductor","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<h3 id=\"problem\">Problem</h3>\n<p>A prominent company in the semiconductor industry was facing challenges in optimizing the cost allocation processes for wafer production and material costs.

We collaboratively identified four potential data science applications for its marketplace: product recommendations, delivery time predictions, dynamic fare pricing, and delivery route optimization. After evaluating the data availability and practicality of each option, we decided to initiate a proof-of-concept initiative focusing on product recommendations within the food segment.</p>\n\n<p>In 2023 alone, the food segment accounted for over 205,000 orders, generating approximately $6 million in revenue for the marketplace. The company’s databases were brimming with underutilized data that had not been leveraged for analytical purposes nor for data-driven management decisions.

Try to enjoy the ride though, it’s actually pretty fun!</em></p>\n\n<p>I began my career by getting fired from my own startup project. Far from discouraging me, it gave me strength and clarity to tackle new challenges.</p>\n\n<p>After a period of burning cash, I needed to find a way to generate a steady income while gaining experience to launch my own business one day.</p>\n\n<p>Consulting seemed to respond best to those needs. My entourage, however, did not seem as enthusiastic:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“You don’t start a career in consulting.”</p>\n\n  <p>“Engineers who work in consulting waste their potential.”</p>\n\n  <p>“Consulting is hard work. Can you handle it?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moreover, my initial consulting experience had been quite hectic, to say the least.</p>\n\n<p>After graduating from EPFL, my startup mentor hired me for a consulting gig. He, his client, and I met for a drink one afternoon to discuss a project. We established deadlines, defined a scope, and off I was to begin my summer project.</p>\n\n<p>A few weeks in, my mentor disappeared without any prior notice. He went on holiday and completely disconnected for nearly a month. Unexpectedly, I was left to handle the client on my own.</p>\n\n<p>The client was eager to disrupt the real estate industry with technology, while I was more focused on meeting expectations. I felt my job hanging by a thread, but I managed to deliver a report detailing realty pricing models that would be subsequently put to use.</p>\n\n<p>Weeks after getting that load off my back, my startup crashed. My last 2 years were gone in the blink of an eye. Fortunately, my university career fair was just around the corner. Out on the market with a failed startup story to tell, every company wanted to hire me.</p>\n\n<p>Skipping over several rounds of interviews, I joined Capgemini’s Insights and Data practice as a Data Analyst. A brand new team consisting of fresh consultants eager for success, led by a distinguished and experienced consultant. We were determined to attack the Swiss market, which was ripe for digitalization after the pandemic. On paper, the project seemed exciting, but in reality, it was destined for disaster. I wasn’t enjoying my experience there, so I left soon after.</p>\n\n<p>During the career fair, I was also in touch with Open Web Technology, a smaller yet reputable consulting firm. Although my head led me towards Capgemini, my heart always pumped for Open Web. The on-site interview had left a great impression on me: they were a small family of entrepreneurs sharing a similar background to mine. After leaving Capgemini, I knew where I wanted to be.</p>\n\n<p>The job did not disappoint. A few months in, I truly believed that I had found my dream job. I was learning a great deal, team events were fun, and, unlike before, my voice was heard.</p>\n\n<p>Naturally, I began taking on more and more responsibilities. With the onset of cold winter days, however, I started feeling overwhelmed. “Had I taken on too much too quickly?” I wondered. Everything was happening so fast, I had no time to pause and reflect. As we were delivering my biggest project yet, I took some time off and realized that the company and I were no longer aligned. I wasn’t growing the way I wanted to, so I quit shortly thereafter.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, I learned some important lessons from my experiences:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A larger company does not necessarily mean it is better for you. As companies grow, they become less prone to taking risks. Their focus shifts toward maintaining profits and market share. Ideally, you should find a company that you can grow with.</li>\n  <li>My generation is used to quick wins and quick rewards (thank you smartphones). When we don’t receive them promptly, we become disappointed. This is important to keep in mind because building trust takes time. Based on my experiences, it takes even longer with older generations.</li>\n  <li>Going through several rounds of interviews is actually beneficial. You get to meet more people and get a better sense of the job. This will give you a better idea of what to expect once you start working.</li>\n  <li>When you start a new job, you’re not starting over — you’re starting from experience. Your experience is what sets you apart from everyone else.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Life is a journey. The destination doesn’t matter as much as the experiences along the way. For me, that journey is only just beginning.</p>\n","url":"/blog/finding-my-path","relative_path":"_en/posts/2023-03-01-finding-my-path.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","permalink":"/blog/:slug","date":"2024-03-27 00:00:00 -0500","title":"How Yoga Transformed Me","description":"Yoga has sparked a profound journey of self-discovery and healing for me; continually pushing boundaries and embracing new ways of living with an open heart and an eager spirit.","tags":["travel","life","story"],"image":"/images/ytt.jpg","slug":"yoga","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p><em>Feeling burned out from my last job and uncertain about my next steps, I decided to pursue a lifelong aspiration of mine: a Yoga Teacher Training.

Since completing the training, my exploration of life’s vast possibilities has been ceaseless, continually pushing boundaries and embracing new ways of living with an open heart and an eager spirit.</em></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"yoga-and-i\">Yoga and I</h2>\n\n<p>My yogi journey began from being frustrated with experiencing intolerable pain in my body after intense physical exercise. Not only did I want to understand the cause of my discomfort, but I also wanted to explore gentler and more-attuned-to-my-body forms of exercising.</p>\n\n<p>Coincidentally, a friend who had been embracing the path of becoming a yoga instructor was inviting people to join her classes. I had been very much inspired by her journey, so I decided to go to my first class: a yin yoga session.</p>\n\n<p>Amidst a summer internship where stress was a constant companion, my first session offered me an unexpected reset; I awoke the next day completely disoriented, unsure of where I was or what day of the week it was. I felt deeply rested and completely rejuvenated.</p>\n\n<p>The impact of yoga was so profound that I was determined to continue practicing. But it wasn’t until the pandemic lockdown that it became an essential part of my life. Thanks to the Down Dog app, I started practicing yoga from home and tailoring sessions to my preferences. I could pick any body area to focus on and even pre-set the duration of each class. Yoga integrated smoothly into my daily routine.</p>\n\n<p>A few months into my yoga practice, its effects on my body became apparent. I ceased snoring, grew more reluctant to drink alcohol and more aware of the impact of different foods on my body. Over time, yoga enhanced many other aspects of my life such as my physical balance, mental focus, tolerance for pain, allergies, my ability to process emotions and adaptability to new environments. But most importantly, it broadened my mindset allowing me to experience and benefit from other disciplines as well.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"stepping-into-a-yoga-teacher-training\">Stepping into a Yoga Teacher Training</h2>\n\n<p>Transitioning from university life and an entrepreneurial venture, I found myself navigating through various roles within the corporate world. After my last job, however, I felt disconnected and burned out. Amidst a period of uncertainty, pursuing a Yoga Teacher Training emerged as a hopeful beacon of clarity.</p>\n\n<p>My heart was set on Lake Atitlán in Guatemala — a place whose magical community had previously captivated me and promised the depth of immersion I yearned for. I considered various venues, eventually settling for the Mystical Yoga Farm as the place for my training. I had never been there, but I was ready to step beyond the familiar confines of my comfort zone.</p>\n\n<p>The farm turned out to offer a variety of activities that nurtured the mind, body and spirit. With yoga sessions, vibrant ecstatic dances, traditional temazcales and peaceful morning lake swims, this place was ideal to recover from life’s heavy upheavals. Beyond my yoga practice, I acquired numerous well-being techniques and practices that I still use today.</p>\n\n<p>The community was also special and played a crucial role in my recovery. Together with everyone at the farm, we cultivated a sanctuary of safety and freedom. The place became a space where every single one of us could freely express themselves and experience warm unconditional love and acceptance from the community. Through each practice, ceremony, and shared moment, my spirit was slowly infused with a profound sense of belonging and love.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/yoga_group.jpg\" alt=\"The Yoga Group\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"studying-the-theory\">Studying the theory</h2>\n\n<p>Amidst the rich social encounters, my exploration into the origins and philosophy of yoga opened new horizons of understanding for me. I learned that yoga was meant to guide you towards enlightenment and help you navigate life’s inevitable sufferings with grace.</p>\n\n<p>Diving into the Yoga Sutras of Patañjali, one of the foundational texts of classical Yoga philosophy, I was introduced to the 8 limbs of yoga. This comprehensive framework provided me with invaluable insights and acted as a blueprint for a life of balance and harmony. The Yamas (ethical restraints) and the Niyamas (observances), for instance, resonated deeply with me. The Yamas taught me the significance of ethical conduct in interactions with the world, learning the importance of practicing non-violence, truthfulness, integrity, moderation, and non-attachment. Conversely, the Niyamas directed my focus inward, highlighting the importance of cleanliness, contentment, discipline, self-study, and surrender to a higher power, as pillars for personal growth and enlightenment.</p>\n\n<p>Our discussions also ventured into the realm of Karma, a concept that had captivated me upon reading Sadhguru’s book. These discussions shed light on the profound truth that each of our actions, thoughts and intentions set forth ripples in the Universe. Karma isn’t just about cause and effect though; it’s about performing actions with purity and without selfish desires, thereby cleansing our hearts and fostering spiritual growth. Understanding Karma as a form of selfless service instilled in me a commitment to live for the benefit of others, viewing such service not only as an act of devotion but as a pathway to authentic spirituality. This has become the cornerstone of my life’s purpose, guiding me to dedicate my life to serving others with an open heart.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"stepping-out-of-the-community\">Stepping out of the community</h2>\n\n<p>Stepping out of this idyllic setting and back into the wider world, riddled with injustice and disconnection, was perhaps the hardest part. Suddenly, I found myself reminded of the pervasive materialism and disconnection that define much of modern society.</p>\n\n<p>I entered waves of depression due to a constant inner struggle that couldn’t accept me falling back into old habits and becoming my former self again. It felt as though I had evolved so much in just a few weeks, yet the world around me hadn’t changed a single bit.</p>\n\n<p>The expectation and pressure from my environment and relationships to behave exactly as I used to were suffocating. It took me months to integrate everything I had learned and to fully accept myself and my past again.</p>\n\n<p>The life I was leading, chasing after success and comfort as defined by society, was taking me further from my true self. Material possessions, job titles, and productivity no longer made sense to me. I realized I had been living a life filled with possessions but devoid of happiness, a life of conformity with little room for growth and authenticity. To find peace and purpose, I had to break away from these chains and wander away from the familiar to discover truths that society overlooks or deliberately ignores.</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, this journey away from the conventional path led me to a community of like-minded souls, individuals who also sought meaning beyond the material, who valued the richness of experience over the accumulation of things. In this community, I found a deeper connection to the essence of life, a shared understanding that there is more to existence than what mainstream culture acknowledges.</p>\n\n<p>As I navigate a world overly characterized by its history, conservative values and an increasingly over-reliance on technology, the lessons learned through yoga and the principles of a more sustainable, human-centric approach to living have never been more relevant. Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we advocate for a society that values the human spirit and the planet over the relentless pursuit of technological advancement and economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>In closing, my journey through yoga has been much more than a path to personal growth; it has been a call to challenge the status quo, to seek a life that is rich in connection, authenticity, and purpose. It is a reminder that happiness and fulfilment lie not in what we own or achieve, but in how deeply we connect with ourselves, with others and ultimately, with our Universe. As I look forward, I hope to carry this wisdom with me and to spread it around me, forging a path that leads not only to individual well-being but to the healing of the world.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/sunset.jpeg\" alt=\"Sunset\" /></p>\n","url":"/blog/yoga","relative_path":"_en/posts/2024-03-27-yoga.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","name":"Atif Aziz","position":"Principal Software Engineer at Microsoft","image":"../images/atif.jpg","blurb":"Adrian does not shy away from challenges.

X étant le courage, la piété, la justice, la tempérance ou la sagesse. Les protagonistes lui donnent des exemples de ces mots abstraits alors qu’ils essaient de trouver une définition. Mais Socrate les rejette tous ; il trouve toujours une utilisation du mot qui ne correspond pas à la définition donnée.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/images/socrates.jpg\" alt=\"Socrate\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"image-caption\"><em>Socrate c. 470–399 BC</em></p>\n\n<p>Dans l’Euthyphron, par exemple, Socrate et Euthyphron tentent de définir de manière définitive le mot piété. Socrate demande : <em>“Qu’est-ce que la piété ?”</em>, ce à quoi Euthyphron répond que la piété est ce qu’il fait actuellement. Socrate rejette cette définition, car l’action d’Euthyphron n’est qu’un exemple et ne fournit pas la caractéristique essentielle qui rend les actions pieuses pieuses. Euthyphron tente de donner quatre autres définitions, mais Socrate continue de les questionner (ce que l’on appelle le <strong>questionnement socratique</strong> ou <strong>méthode socratique</strong>). Euthyphron finit par perdre patience et laisse Socrate sans une définition claire de la piété.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*JvZwMoSu7ABRDgQU\" alt=\"Euthyphron\" /></p>\n\n<p>Socrate cherchait une nature commune parmi les exemples qui lui étaient donnés pour trouver une définition réelle. Il croyait que la nature commune justifiait l’utilisation du nom commun, qu’il était contraire à l’éthique d’utiliser des mots si leur signification n’était pas vraiment connue. Par exemple, on ne pouvait être juste que si l’on connaissait la nature commune sous-jacente de la justice. Mais ni Socrate ni aucun des protagonistes des dialogues socratiques ne parviennent jamais à trouver de vraies définitions. Le travail inachevé suggérait que la philosophie avait encore beaucoup de progrès à faire. En tout cas, Socrate croyait que prendre conscience de son ignorance le rendait plus sage que ceux qui, bien qu’ignorants, prétendaient encore avoir des connaissances.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Je sais que je ne sais rien.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>le paradoxe socratique</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Des siècles plus tard, Ludwig Wittgenstein tenterait de reprendre le travail inachevé de Socrate. Il croyait cependant que l’approche des gens consistant à donner des exemples de mots était correcte.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Je ne peux mieux caractériser mon point de vue qu’en disant qu’il est le point de vue opposé à celui occupé par Socrate dans les dialogues platoniciens. Car si on me demandait ce qu’est la connaissance, j’énumérerais des exemples de connaissance et j’ajouterais les mots ‘et des choses similaires’. Il n’y a pas de constituant commun à découvrir puisqu’il n’en existe pas.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Voices of Wittgenstein, Waismann &amp; Wittgenstein, 2003, p. 33</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*z-u5VJtjCSKd2xiL.webp\" alt=\"Wittgenstein\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"image-caption\"><em>Ludwig Wittgenstein 1889–1951</em></p>\n\n<p>Dans les Investigations Philosophiques, il considère des exemples du mot jeu pour illustrer son propos.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Considérez par exemple les activités que nous appelons “jeux”. Je veux dire les jeux de plateau, les jeux de cartes, les jeux de balle, les jeux olympiques, etc. Qu’ont-ils tous en commun ? Ne dites pas : “Il doit y avoir quelque chose en commun, sinon ils ne seraient pas appelés ‘jeux’” — mais regardez et voyez s’il y a quelque chose de commun à tous. — Car si vous les regardez, vous ne verrez pas quelque chose de commun à tous, mais des similitudes, des relations, et toute une série de celles-ci. Pour répéter : ne pensez pas, mais regardez !</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Investigations Philosophiques, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 31</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein suggère de regarder au lieu de penser, et de décrire au lieu d’expliquer. Penser est un processus abstrait soumis au point de vue corrompu de l’esprit, tandis que regarder est pratique et évite ce biais. Wittgenstein soutenait que les choses, qui pouvaient sembler être connectées par une caractéristique commune essentielle, peuvent en fait être connectées par une série de similitudes qui se chevauchent, où aucune caractéristique n’est commune à toutes les choses. Il a appelé ce concept <strong>ressemblance de famille</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Je ne peux penser à une meilleure expression pour caractériser ces similitudes que “ressemblances de famille”;… Et je dirai : ‘les jeux’ forment une famille.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Investigations Philosophiques, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 32</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein ne pensait pas que les mots correspondaient à des choses. La fonction et la signification d’un mot étaient déterminées par son usage. La définition n’est pas quelque chose de préalable à l’utilisation d’un mot qui en fixe le sens et détermine comment il sera utilisé, mais plutôt un outil descriptif qui reflète les diverses façons dont un mot est utilisé :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Pensez aux outils dans une boîte à outils : il y a un marteau, des pinces, une scie, un tournevis, une règle, un pot de colle, des clous et des vis. — Les fonctions des mots sont aussi diverses que les fonctions de ces objets.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Investigations Philosophiques, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 6</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein considérait le langage comme un outil utilisé pour accomplir des objectifs et des activités quotidiennes, qui déterminent essentiellement la signification d’un mot. Il appelait ces activités <strong>jeux de langage</strong>, parce que les règles du langage étaient comme les règles d’un jeu, et dire quelque chose était comme faire un mouvement dans un jeu.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Ici, le terme “jeu de langage” est censé mettre en évidence le fait que le parler de la langue fait partie d’une activité, ou d’une forme de vie.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Investigations Philosophiques, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 11</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bien que nos cerveaux associent naturellement des images aux mots, même lorsqu’il s’agit de mots abstraits comme justice ou âme, les mots en réalité ne nous disent rien sur la véritable nature de la chose qu’ils représentent. Le principal point de Wittgenstein était de s’éloigner de nos images mentales lorsqu’il s’agissait de philosophie, car chacun avait une image différente qui obscurcissait la réalité.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Une image nous retenait captifs. Et nous ne pouvions pas en sortir, car elle se trouvait dans notre langue et la langue semblait nous la répéter inexorablement.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Investigations Philosophiques, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 48</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>D’un autre côté, même si l’on pouvait trouver une définition essentielle d’un mot, cela ne contredirait pas l’argument de Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein n’est pas nécessairement contre les définitions, car dans de nombreux cas, des définitions essentielles existent et sont même nécessaires, généralement dans des contextes scientifiques. Mais il ne pense pas que tous les mots doivent avoir une définition essentielle, il propose donc le concept de ressemblance de famille. Cela soulève la question : <em>Comment pouvons-nous savoir quels termes ont des définitions essentielles et lesquels n’en ont pas ?</em> La revendication de Wittgenstein rend la définition d’un concept plus facile en abaissant les attentes de ce qui est requis, mais le défi est de rester précis.</p>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein valorisait la clarté plus que la vérité universelle, ce qui le distinguait vraiment en tant que philosophe. Les philosophes se demandent généralement pourquoi pour découvrir des vérités cachées et considèrent que c’est ce qu’ils peuvent faire de plus profond. Wittgenstein, en revanche, considérait que regarder était beaucoup plus profond et y voyait une grande difficulté car il fallait apprendre à ignorer de nombreuses préconceptions qui obscurcissent notre jugement. Wittgenstein affirmant qu’il n’y a pas de constituant commun dans la connaissance serait typiquement réprimandé par la plupart des philosophes, en particulier Socrate, car il abandonne la recherche de la vérité. Bien que Wittgenstein donne des réponses valables à de nombreuses questions philosophiques, il soulève inévitablement d’autres questions, comme quels termes ont des définitions essentielles et lesquels n’en ont pas. Comme dans le cas de Socrate, il reste encore du travail à faire à cet égard. Mais en réponse à de nombreux critiques, Wittgenstein dirait :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Le mystique n’est pas comment le monde est, mais qu’il est.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 1922</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n","url":"/fr/blog/wittgenstein","relative_path":"_fr/posts/2020-04-14-wittgenstein.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","permalink":"/fr/blog/:slug","date":"2021-01-28 00:00:00 -0600","title":"7 Leçons pour les Étudiants-Entrepreneurs","description":"7 leçons précieuses pour aider les autres étudiants-entrepreneurs à progresser dans leurs objectifs et ambitions.","tags":["carrière","entrepreneuriat"],"image":"/images/woods_antoinebruy.jpg","slug":"7-lessons","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p><em>Cet article s’adresse aux étudiants-entrepreneurs désireux de lancer leur startup.

J’ai appris des leçons précieuses que j’espère pouvoir aider d’autres étudiants entreprenants à progresser dans leurs objectifs et ambitions.</em></p>\n\n<p>L’entrepreneuriat commence toujours par une idée. Mais les idées n’ont pas autant d’importance que nous le pensons initialement. L’effort soutenu, les leçons de votre parcours, et finalement, les leçons sur vous-même comptent beaucoup plus.</p>\n\n<p>Lancer une startup est une grande initiative. Encore plus, si cela implique de refuser ou de quitter un emploi. Lorsque j’ai commencé, je me concentrais sur la réalisation de mes idées. Je ne savais pas vraiment dans quoi je m’engageais — heureusement, car sinon je ne l’aurais pas fait.</p>\n\n<p>L’entrepreneuriat est une sacrée aventure. Une startup, c’est bien plus que des idées. Une vision claire est cruciale pour recruter une équipe diversifiée de talents. Mais c’est seulement en vous mettant constamment en première ligne, en assumant des responsabilités et en montrant la voie à suivre que vous gagnez pleinement la confiance et la confiance de votre équipe.</p>\n\n<p>Voici quelques leçons clés de mon expérience en tant qu’étudiant-entrepreneur :</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-acceptez-léchec\">1. Acceptez l’échec.</h2>\n<p>Vous allez échouer. Mais c’est normal, car échouer fait partie de la vie.</p>\n\n<p>Elon Musk, l’un des plus grands entrepreneurs de notre génération, a dit qu’il pensait que SpaceX et Tesla échoueraient, mais il était parfaitement d’accord avec cela. Quand les gens me demandaient quels étaient les risques d’échec, je leur répondais que si j’échouais, je serais heureux de vivre dans la nature.</p>\n\n<p>Si vous voulez penser comme un entrepreneur, préparez-vous à échouer. J’ai rencontré une équipe de brillants étudiants-entrepreneurs qui ont travaillé très dur sur leur projet pendant trop longtemps. Ils ont fini par être dégoûtés de l’entrepreneuriat lorsqu’ils ont décidé de tirer la prise. C’est vraiment dommage, car les startups sont censées être amusantes. Trop souvent, nous entendons des histoires épiques d’entrepreneurs qui réussissent à s’en sortir quand les choses semblent sombres, mais nous entendons rarement parler des innombrables autres qui ne le font pas. Lorsque votre startup perd de la traction, admettre l’échec est probablement l’une des choses les plus difficiles mais les meilleures à faire.</p>\n\n<p>Acceptez l’échec. Vous admettrez plus facilement la défaite lorsque votre startup est en train de couler. Plus important encore : vous essayerez plus, vous apprendrez plus et vous réaliserez plus.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-communiquez\">2. Communiquez.</h2>\n<p>Si vous lancez une startup, vous voulez diffuser l’information autant que possible car vous ne savez jamais qui pourrait vous apporter une aide cruciale plus tard.</p>\n\n<p>Lors de l’ajout de membres à l’équipe, sachez que le succès de votre équipe dépend d’une bonne communication au sein de votre startup. Non seulement des membres supplémentaires créent une surcharge de communication significative (voir la loi de Brook ci-dessous), mais ils peuvent également poser un risque si cette personne ne s’intègre pas à la culture de la startup.</p>\n\n<p>La loi de Brook : une grande taille d’équipe représente une surcharge significative en termes de communication.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pLdfse5oA5nJOEjemvmgig.webp\" alt=\"Lignes de communication\" /></p>\n\n<p>Traitez votre équipe comme votre famille : vous travaillez pour eux, ils ne travaillent pas pour vous. Soyez prêt à vous adapter aux besoins de votre équipe, et assurez-vous que les personnes que vous laissez entrer ont à la fois la capacité et la personnalité pour travailler dans une startup. Une personne toxique peut suffire à gâcher le plaisir. Perdre des membres de l’équipe est l’une des pires choses qui puisse arriver à une startup, car la main-d’œuvre est si petite.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"3-ne-réfléchissez-pas-agissez\">3. Ne réfléchissez pas, agissez.</h2>\n<p>Trop réfléchir est un problème classique de perte de temps pour les entrepreneurs inexpérimentés. Évitez la paralysie de l’analyse en simplifiant les choses à faire. En ce sens, reconnaître les décisions de porte à sens unique et à double sens peut aider.</p>\n\n<p>Les décisions de porte à sens unique sont des décisions que vous ne pouvez pas facilement inverser. Elles doivent être prises méthodiquement, soigneusement, lentement, avec une grande délibération et consultation. Les décisions de porte à double sens, en revanche, peuvent être inversées. Vous pouvez passer la porte, voir si cela vous plaît, et sinon, revenir en arrière. Ces décisions doivent être automatisées ou déléguées. La plupart des décisions sont des décisions de porte à double sens, alors apprenez à les prendre aussi rapidement que possible.</p>\n\n<p>Dans l’ensemble, cherchez à développer des habitudes qui vous permettent d’agir et de réfléchir efficacement, tout en vous débarrassant des mauvaises. Apprenez à dire non, afin de vous concentrer sur ce à quoi vous dites oui.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"4-écoutez-attentivement\">4. Écoutez attentivement.</h2>\n<p>Ce n’est pas parce que vous dirigez une startup que vous avez toujours raison.</p>\n\n<p>Écoutez attentivement tout le monde autour de vous : votre équipe, vos clients, vos partenaires, vos amis. Entourez-vous de personnes qui pensent différemment. Encouragez les membres de l’équipe à générer et à brainstormer de nouvelles idées. Appréciez d’entendre des choses qui vous mettent mal à l’aise.</p>\n\n<p>Parlez aux clients. Mettez-vous à la place des autres. Apprenez à penser à ce à quoi vous ne pensez pas. La vérité peut faire mal, mais un manque de vérité fera encore plus mal à long terme.</p>\n\n<p>Ne tombez pas dans le piège de suivre aveuglément ce que disent les autres. Tout le monde aime penser qu’il connaît quelques choses sur les affaires. Apprenez à repérer les personnes qui parlent par vanité — ce ne sont probablement pas celles à qui vous devriez suivre les conseils ou même discuter avec. Lisez les gens à travers leurs émotions, plutôt que leurs mots.</p>\n\n<p>En fin de compte, vous devez former vos propres opinions. Utilisez la puissance cérébrale collective des personnes autour de vous pour faire la majeure partie de la réflexion — vous ne faites qu’orchestrer.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"5-faites-vous-confiance\">5. Faites-vous confiance.</h2>\n<p>Recherchez des progrès réguliers, plutôt que des objectifs ambitieux irréalistes.</p>\n\n<p>Il y aura toujours des choses que vous ne pouvez pas contrôler. Lorsque les objectifs ou les attentes ne sont pas atteints, gardez une vue objective pour vous contenter de progrès réguliers. Ne soyez pas trop dur avec vous-même et avec les autres — tout le monde fait de son mieux. Faites-le assez longtemps et vous finirez par gagner le gros lot. Tout le monde a de la chance parfois.</p>\n\n<p>La définition du succès est également très subjective. En fin de compte, le seul qui peut juger si vous réussissez ou non, c’est vous. Croyez en vous. Vous êtes capable de devenir qui vous voulez. Rêvez. Ayez foi.</p>\n\n<p>Enfin, les leaders doivent avoir suffisamment de caractère pour instaurer la confiance. Sans confiance, vous n’avez pas de suiveurs. Sans suiveurs, qui dirigez-vous ? Commencez par vous faire confiance. Vous ferez plus facilement confiance aux autres et les autres vous feront également plus confiance.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"6-améliorez-vos-relations\">6. Améliorez vos relations.</h2>\n<p>Cherchez à améliorer vos relations, en commençant par celles qui vous sont les plus proches. Lorsque j’ai commencé mon parcours entrepreneurial, non seulement je prenais un certain risque, mais je voulais lancer une startup de cannabis. Vous pouvez imaginer que mes parents n’étaient pas totalement pour.</p>\n\n<p>La route d’une startup est longue, vous devez compter sur l’enthousiasme des autres pour continuer. Faites adhérer votre famille et vos amis à votre vision. Non seulement cela vous fournira un précieux soutien moral, mais plus de personnes voudront vous aider.</p>\n\n<p>L’entrepreneuriat est comme le sport. Lorsque vous perdez, vous devez être le premier à vous remettre sur pied et à encourager les membres de l’équipe à continuer, peu importe la dureté du coup que vous venez de subir. Quand les choses vont mal, n’abandonnez pas. Quand les choses vont bien, soyez réaliste.</p>\n\n<p>Améliorer toutes vos relations vous aidera à diriger avec plus d’empathie et à répandre la positivité dans votre startup. Tout le monde appréciera beaucoup plus le voyage.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"7-connaissez-vous\">7. Connaissez-vous.</h2>\n<p>Quelques questions philosophiques que vous devriez constamment vous poser tout au long de votre parcours :</p>\n\n<p>Qui êtes-vous ?\nPourquoi faites-vous ce que vous faites ?\nQuel est le changement que vous aimeriez voir dans le monde ?\nLa philosophie agit comme une boussole morale. S’interroger sur votre compréhension de la réalité, de la connaissance et de la façon dont vous devriez vivre vous fournira des principes qui peuvent vous aider à ne plus jamais vous sentir perdu dans la vie.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>« La science est ce que vous savez. La philosophie est ce que vous ne savez pas. »</p>\n\n  <p>Bertrand Russell</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mettez régulièrement du temps de côté pour vous détendre et réfléchir. Construisez votre caractère. Rappelez-vous, vous jouez sur le long terme, alors efforcez-vous de rester en bonne santé à long terme. Calmer votre esprit stimulera votre créativité. Mes meilleures idées viennent en me relaxant, pas quand je les cherche désespérément.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"réflexions-finales\">Réflexions finales</h2>\n<p>Pour résumer, concentrez-vous sur vous-même et le reste suivra. Parfois, vous devrez peut-être être patient, mais le travail acharné finit par payer.</p>\n\n<p>Beaucoup des leçons que j’ai apprises, ainsi que plusieurs habitudes que j’ai adoptées, ont été inspirées par le stoïcisme. Les principes stoïciens offrent des moyens utiles et pratiques de trouver la tranquillité et d’améliorer ses forces de caractère.

Ce projet souligne le potentiel des méthodes NLP avancées pour exploiter les données des réseaux sociaux afin de suivre le sentiment public et les habitudes d’utilisation liées aux produits de santé comme le CBD. Il met en évidence l’importance de la surveillance des réseaux sociaux comme méthode rapide, pratique et rentable pour compléter les sources de surveillance traditionnelles.

Malgré le résultat final, les leçons ont été inestimables. Aujourd’hui, je me sens plus résilient que jamais pour affronter les prochains défis que la vie me réservera.</em></p>\n\n<p>Pendant que je poursuivais mon Master à l’EPFL, j’ai réalisé à quel point j’avais de la chance d’avoir un écosystème de startup qui offrait un soutien aux étudiants entrepreneurs. L’université semblait vraiment être le meilleur moment pour lancer une startup. Cela m’a également motivé pour mes études : je ne voulais plus simplement les terminer, je voulais profiter de l’expérience et rester un peu plus longtemps.</p>\n\n<p>La naïveté, la curiosité et un fort désir d’exprimer ma créativité m’ont poussé vers l’entrepreneuriat. La série d’actions qui ont suivi m’a fait grandir de manière que je n’aurais jamais pu imaginer. Prendre des responsabilités, communiquer régulièrement et faire confiance aux bonnes personnes étaient des compétences que je n’aurais pas pu développer en classe ou à travers un manuel. Si j’avais su à quel point le chemin entrepreneurial serait difficile, je ne l’aurais jamais poursuivi en premier lieu.</p>\n\n<p>J’ai commencé à brainstormer plusieurs idées, mais j’ai finalement opté pour le Vivino du CBD. Mon père devenait assez expert en vin grâce à Vivino, tandis qu’un ami s’apprêtait à commencer un travail dans une entreprise de CBD. J’ai essayé le CBD pour le sommeil, le stress, les douleurs musculaires et même dans le cadre de mes pratiques spirituelles. J’ai découvert combien il y avait de science autour de la plante de cannabis, mais combien peu de choses étaient présentées au public.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*RapTk4VMeNkn3yNC\" alt=\"CBD\" /></p>\n\n<p>Des pairs universitaires m’ont recommandé un cours de startup donné par l’Agence suisse pour l’innovation. Les participants devaient présenter leur idée en espérant travailler dessus tout au long du cours. Les projets sélectionnés auraient la possibilité de recruter des membres de l’équipe et d’avoir des coachs qui leur fourniraient régulièrement des retours. L’un d’eux deviendrait mon mentor et partenaire commercial : Haider Alleg.</p>\n\n<p>Mais les choses auraient pu se passer très différemment dès le début. Haider a raté la présentation entre les coachs et les startups. Quelques semaines plus tard, j’ai reçu un long fil de courriels entre Haider et un autre coach. Haider avait essayé de me joindre, mais les messages avaient fini dans la mauvaise boîte aux lettres.</p>\n\n<p>Lorsque nous avons enfin réussi à organiser notre première réunion en personne, il est arrivé avec plus d’une heure de retard. Je suis entré à notre réunion agacé, mais j’en suis sorti émerveillé par l’élan qu’il nous donnait déjà. Il m’a envoyé un duplicata de son site Wordpress pour un projet similaire, dans lequel il avait investi du temps et de l’argent. Il avait besoin de quelques ajustements, mais en une semaine, nous pouvions avoir notre produit minimum viable.</p>\n\n<p>Malheureusement, l’excitation n’a pas duré. Les cours, les échéances de projets et les examens de fin d’année prenaient plus de temps que prévu. De plus, mon équipe n’aidait pas autant que je l’aurais espéré. Je me sentais dépassé.</p>\n\n<p>Néanmoins, les contributions de Haider nous ont permis de continuer. Ses conseils étaient si précieux que parfois il me fallait des mois pour réaliser ce qu’il disait depuis le début. Lorsque le cours s’est terminé, mes coéquipiers ont quitté le projet. Haider ne pouvait pas m’imaginer avancer sans équipe ni argent.</p>\n\n<p>Pourtant, je ne sentais pas que c’était le moment d’abandonner. J’ai commencé à contacter des amis qui pourraient être intéressés par le projet. Une fois que j’avais recruté mes premiers membres d’équipe, la situation s’est inversée : les gens venaient vers moi pour offrir leur aide. Nous sommes entrés dans notre meilleure phase de lune de miel. Lancer une startup était amusant !</p>\n\n<p>Tout allait pour le mieux jusqu’à ce qu’un jour, mon ami qui écrivait des articles de blog m’annonce qu’il quittait. J’étais dévasté, mais je n’ai pas perdu de temps à chercher de nouveaux recrues potentielles.</p>\n\n<p>Je discutais des termes avec un nouveau co-fondateur quand Haider a appelé. Il avait un nouveau projet pour moi. Son ami avait développé une plateforme de trading de matières premières agricoles et cherchait à la déployer dans de nouvelles industries telles que le cannabis. Au début, j’étais hésitant. Comment pouvais-je abandonner tout ce que j’avais accompli au cours de l’année passée ? Après avoir vu la plateforme, il est devenu clair que ce projet nécessitait toute mon attention incontestée.</p>\n\n<p>J’ai arrêté le projet précédent et commencé à me consacrer au nouveau. Nous avions des réunions chaque semaine. J’étais le plus junior des trois, donc chaque réunion était incroyablement stimulante — j’apprenais tellement !</p>\n\n<p>Dix mois plus tard, un mélange de circonstances — y compris un manque d’expérience de ma part — nous a fait perdre de la traction. Les dynamiques de l’équipe n’étaient plus en place et finalement, nous avons convenu que la meilleure solution était de nous séparer.</p>\n\n<p>Étrangement, tirer la prise pour la deuxième fois était beaucoup plus facile que la première. J’étais heureux de constater une réduction de la demi-vie de mes émotions, essentielle pour aller de l’avant dans la vie.</p>\n\n<p>Je me sens extrêmement chanceux d’avoir eu une expérience dont je continuerai d’apprendre pendant des années. Un immense merci à tous ceux que j’ai rencontrés en cours de route. En particulier mes parents pour leur soutien inconditionnel. Rien de tout cela n’aurait été possible sans eux.</p>\n\n<p>Et rappelez-vous : <em>échouez rapidement, apprenez plus vite.</em></p>\n","url":"/fr/blog/fail-fast-learn-faster","relative_path":"_fr/posts/2021-09-15-fail-fast-learn-faster.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"project","permalink":"/fr/portfolio/:slug","date":"2022-01-14 22:20:35 -0600","title":"Allocation Automatisée des Coûts Basée sur les Entrées Historiques des Contrôleurs Financiers","subtitle":"Machine Learning","image":"/images/semiconductor.jpg","slug":"semiconductor","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<h3 id=\"problème\">Problème</h3>\n<p>Une entreprise éminente dans l’industrie des semi-conducteurs faisait face à des défis pour optimiser les processus d’allocation des coûts pour la production de wafers et les coûts des matériaux.

De plus, l’interface utilisateur existante manquait de toute forme de recommandations personnalisées. L’objectif du client était d’explorer le potentiel de la science des données pour améliorer l’expérience utilisateur en offrant des recommandations alimentaires personnalisées.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n\n<p>Nous avons identifié les besoins en données pour construire un pipeline de recommandation de produits et avons collecté les données nécessaires. En nous inspirant des techniques avancées de recommandation d’<a href=\"https://www.uber.com/en-CH/blog/uber-eats-recommending-place de marché/\">Uber Eats</a>, nous avons conçu un pipeline de recommandation de produits combinant des méthodes de filtrage basé sur le contenu et collaboratif pour fournir des suggestions alimentaires personnalisées. Le processus de développement a inclus plusieurs étapes clés :</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Collecte de Données</strong> : Nous avons commencé par extraire et manipuler les données pertinentes des utilisateurs et des produits à partir de MongoDB, en convertissant ces informations en DataFrames pandas pour une analyse approfondie.</li>\n  <li><strong>Analyse Exploratoire des Données (EDA)</strong> : Nous avons mené une analyse exploratoire complète des données pour identifier les motifs et les relations au sein des données, essentiels pour affiner nos stratégies de recommandation en fonction des comportements réels des utilisateurs et des attributs des produits.</li>\n  <li><strong>Filtrage Basé sur le Contenu</strong> : Nous avons créé des profils de goûts des utilisateurs et des aliments en utilisant des caractéristiques extraites des descriptions de produits et des préférences des utilisateurs. Ces profils ont été convertis en vecteurs numériques à l’aide de DictVectorizer de sklearn, permettant le calcul des scores de similarité entre les goûts des utilisateurs et les profils de produits.</li>\n  <li><strong>Filtrage Collaboratif</strong> : Cette technique a exploité les historiques d’achat des utilisateurs pour identifier les produits favoris des utilisateurs similaires, capturant ainsi efficacement les préférences évolutives des utilisateurs.</li>\n  <li><strong>Approche Hybride</strong> : En intégrant le filtrage basé sur le contenu et collaboratif, notre moteur a pu recommander des articles alimentaires qui correspondaient non seulement aux préférences précédentes, mais incluaient également des articles populaires parmi les utilisateurs similaires, améliorant ainsi à la fois la précision et la découverte.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"outils-utilisés\">Outils Utilisés</h3>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>MongoDB</strong> : Base de données principale pour le stockage des données utilisateurs et produits.</li>\n  <li><strong>Python</strong> : Langage de programmation principal pour développer les algorithmes de recommandation et effectuer l’analyse des données.</li>\n  <li><strong>Pandas</strong> : Utilisé pour la manipulation et l’analyse des données afin de convertir les données brutes en informations exploitables.</li>\n  <li><strong>Matplotlib</strong> : Bibliothèque principale utilisée pour visualiser les tendances des données et les résultats des algorithmes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Sklearn (DictVectorizer)</strong> : Utilisé pour encoder les données catégorielles en vecteurs numériques, crucial pour nos modèles d’apprentissage automatique.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"résultat\">Résultat</h3>\n\n<p>Le pipeline de recommandation a démontré le potentiel de mise en œuvre de solutions complexes basées sur l’IA dans des scénarios réels. Son succès marque une étape prometteuse vers l’extension des services de recommandation à d’autres segments de la place de marché, transformant potentiellement l’expérience d’achat des clients à travers diverses catégories. De plus, cette initiative a souligné l’importance de données bien structurées, ordonnées et maintenues pour prendre des décisions basées sur les données. Elle a également révélé des lacunes dans les pipelines de données existants qui, une fois corrigées, pourraient encore affiner l’expérience utilisateur du produit.</p>\n\n<p>Dans les semaines à venir, cette preuve de concept sera mise en place dans un environnement de test au sein de la place de marché. Cela nous permettra de simuler de près l’utilisation réelle et d’apporter les ajustements nécessaires avant de procéder à un déploiement à grande échelle.</p>\n","url":"/fr/portfolio/food-recommendations","relative_path":"_fr/projects/2024-04-01-food-recommendations.md"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","permalink":"/fr/blog/:slug","date":"2023-03-01 00:00:00 -0600","title":"Trouver ma voie","image":"/images/path.jpg","description":"Accrochez-vous, car la vie est une montagne russe.

Essayez d’en profiter tout de même - elle est amusante !</em></p>\n\n<p>J’ai commencé ma carrière en étant licencié de mon propre projet de startup. Loin de me décourager, cela m’a donné la force et la clarté nécessaires pour relever de nouveaux défis.</p>\n\n<p>Après une période de dépenses excessives, j’avais besoin de trouver un moyen de générer un revenu stable tout en acquérant de l’expérience pour lancer un jour ma propre entreprise.</p>\n\n<p>Le consulting semblait répondre au mieux à ces besoins. Mon entourage, cependant, n’était pas aussi enthousiaste :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“On ne commence pas une carrière dans le consulting.”</p>\n\n  <p>“Les ingénieurs qui travaillent dans le consulting gaspillent leur potentiel.”</p>\n\n  <p>“Le consulting, c’est du travail acharné. Pouvez-vous le supporter ?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>De plus, mon expérience initiale en consulting avait été pour le moins mouvementée.</p>\n\n<p>Après avoir obtenu mon diplôme de l’EPFL, mon mentor de startup m’a embauché pour une mission de consulting. Lui, son client et moi nous sommes rencontrés un après-midi pour discuter d’un projet. Nous avons établi des délais, défini un périmètre et j’ai commencé mon projet d’été.</p>\n\n<p>Quelques semaines plus tard, mon mentor a disparu sans préavis. Il est parti en vacances et s’est complètement déconnecté pendant près d’un mois. De manière inattendue, j’ai dû gérer le client tout seul.</p>\n\n<p>Le client était désireux de révolutionner l’industrie immobilière avec la technologie, tandis que je me concentrais davantage sur la satisfaction des attentes. Je sentais mon emploi suspendu à un fil, mais j’ai réussi à livrer un rapport détaillant les modèles de tarification immobilière qui seraient ensuite utilisés.</p>\n\n<p>Quelques semaines après m’être débarrassé de cette charge, ma startup a échoué. Mes deux dernières années se sont envolées en un clin d’œil. Heureusement, le forum de l’emploi de mon université était tout proche. Sur le marché avec une histoire de startup échouée à raconter, toutes les entreprises voulaient m’embaucher.</p>\n\n<p>En sautant plusieurs tours d’entretiens, j’ai rejoint la pratique Insights and Data de Capgemini en tant que Data Analyst. Une toute nouvelle équipe composée de consultants frais et désireux de réussir, dirigée par un consultant distingué et expérimenté. Nous étions déterminés à attaquer le marché suisse, qui était mûr pour la digitalisation après la pandémie. Sur le papier, le projet semblait excitant, mais en réalité, il était destiné à l’échec. Je ne profitais pas de mon expérience là-bas, alors je suis parti peu de temps après.</p>\n\n<p>Pendant le forum de l’emploi, j’étais également en contact avec Open Web Technology, une société de conseil plus petite mais réputée. Bien que ma tête m’ait conduit vers Capgemini, mon cœur battait toujours pour Open Web. L’entretien sur place m’avait laissé une excellente impression : c’était une petite famille d’entrepreneurs partageant un parcours similaire au mien. Après avoir quitté Capgemini, je savais où je voulais être.</p>\n\n<p>Le travail ne m’a pas déçu. Quelques mois plus tard, je croyais vraiment avoir trouvé mon emploi de rêve. J’apprenais beaucoup, les événements d’équipe étaient amusants et, contrairement à avant, ma voix était entendue.</p>\n\n<p>Naturellement, j’ai commencé à prendre de plus en plus de responsabilités. Avec l’arrivée des jours froids d’hiver, cependant, j’ai commencé à me sentir dépassé. “Avais-je pris trop de responsabilités trop vite ?” me demandais-je. Tout se passait si vite, je n’avais pas le temps de faire une pause et de réfléchir. Alors que nous livrions mon plus grand projet à ce jour, j’ai pris un peu de temps libre et j’ai réalisé que l’entreprise et moi n’étions plus alignés. Je ne grandissais pas comme je le voulais, alors j’ai quitté peu de temps après.</p>\n\n<p>Néanmoins, j’ai tiré d’importantes leçons de mes expériences :</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Une plus grande entreprise ne signifie pas nécessairement qu’elle est meilleure pour vous. À mesure que les entreprises grandissent, elles deviennent moins enclines à prendre des risques. Leur attention se déplace vers le maintien des profits et des parts de marché. Idéalement, vous devriez trouver une entreprise avec laquelle vous pouvez grandir.</li>\n  <li>Ma génération est habituée aux gains rapides et aux récompenses rapides (merci les smartphones). Lorsque nous ne les recevons pas rapidement, nous devenons déçus. C’est important à garder à l’esprit car établir la confiance prend du temps. D’après mes expériences, cela prend encore plus de temps avec les générations plus âgées.</li>\n  <li>Passer par plusieurs tours d’entretiens est en fait bénéfique. Vous rencontrez plus de personnes et avez une meilleure idée du travail. Cela vous donnera une meilleure idée de ce à quoi vous attendre une fois que vous commencerez à travailler.</li>\n  <li>Lorsque vous commencez un nouvel emploi, vous ne repartez pas de zéro — vous repartez de l’expérience. Votre expérience est ce qui vous distingue des autres.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>La vie est un voyage. La destination importe moins que les expériences vécues en cours de route. Pour moi, ce voyage ne fait que commencer.</p>\n","url":"/fr/blog/finding-my-path","relative_path":"_fr/posts/2023-03-01-finding-my-path.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","permalink":"/fr/blog/:slug","date":"2024-03-27 00:00:00 -0500","title":"Comment le yoga m'a transformé","description":"Le yoga a déclenché un profond voyage de découverte de soi et de guérison pour moi ; repoussant continuellement les limites et embrassant de nouvelles façons de vivre avec un cœur ouvert et un esprit avide.","tags":["voyage","vie","histoire"],"image":"/images/ytt.jpg","slug":"yoga","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p><em>Épuisé par mon dernier emploi et incertain de mes prochaines étapes, j’ai décidé de poursuivre une aspiration de longue date : une formation de professeur de yoga.

Non seulement je voulais comprendre la cause de mon inconfort, mais je voulais également explorer des formes d’exercice plus douces et plus adaptées à mon corps.</p>\n\n<p>Par coïncidence, une amie qui embrassait la voie pour devenir instructrice de yoga invitait des gens à rejoindre ses cours. J’avais été très inspiré par son parcours, alors j’ai décidé d’aller à mon premier cours : une séance de yin yoga.</p>\n\n<p>Au milieu d’un stage d’été où le stress était un compagnon constant, ma première séance m’a offert une réinitialisation inattendue ; je me suis réveillé le lendemain complètement désorienté, ne sachant pas où j’étais ni quel jour de la semaine c’était. Je me sentais profondément reposé et complètement rajeuni.</p>\n\n<p>L’impact du yoga a été si profond que j’étais déterminé à continuer à pratiquer. Mais ce n’est que pendant le confinement de la pandémie qu’il est devenu une partie essentielle de ma vie. Grâce à l’application Down Dog, j’ai commencé à pratiquer le yoga à la maison et à adapter les séances à mes préférences. Je pouvais choisir n’importe quelle zone du corps sur laquelle me concentrer et même prédéfinir la durée de chaque cours. Le yoga s’est intégré sans heurts dans ma routine quotidienne.</p>\n\n<p>Quelques mois après avoir commencé ma pratique du yoga, ses effets sur mon corps sont devenus apparents. J’ai cessé de ronfler, je suis devenu plus réticent à boire de l’alcool et plus conscient de l’impact de différents aliments sur mon corps. Au fil du temps, le yoga a amélioré de nombreux autres aspects de ma vie, comme mon équilibre physique, ma concentration mentale, ma tolérance à la douleur, mes allergies, ma capacité à traiter les émotions et mon adaptabilité à de nouveaux environnements. Mais surtout, il a élargi ma mentalité, me permettant d’expérimenter et de bénéficier d’autres disciplines également.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"se-lancer-dans-une-formation-de-professeur-de-yoga\">Se lancer dans une formation de professeur de yoga</h2>\n\n<p>Passant de la vie universitaire et d’une aventure entrepreneuriale, je me suis retrouvé à naviguer à travers divers rôles dans le monde de l’entreprise. Après mon dernier emploi, cependant, je me sentais déconnecté et épuisé. En période d’incertitude, poursuivre une formation de professeur de yoga est apparu comme une lueur d’espoir de clarté.</p>\n\n<p>Mon cœur était tourné vers le lac Atitlán au Guatemala — un endroit dont la communauté magique m’avait déjà captivé et promettait la profondeur d’immersion que je recherchais. J’ai envisagé divers lieux, finissant par choisir la Mystical Yoga Farm comme lieu de ma formation. Je n’y étais jamais allé, mais j’étais prêt à sortir des limites familières de ma zone de confort.</p>\n\n<p>La ferme s’est avérée offrir une variété d’activités qui nourrissaient l’esprit, le corps et l’âme. Avec des séances de yoga, des danses extatiques vibrantes, des temazcales traditionnels et des baignades matinales paisibles dans le lac, cet endroit était idéal pour se remettre des lourds bouleversements de la vie. Au-delà de ma pratique du yoga, j’ai acquis de nombreuses techniques et pratiques de bien-être que j’utilise encore aujourd’hui.</p>\n\n<p>La communauté était également spéciale et a joué un rôle crucial dans ma récupération. Ensemble, avec tout le monde à la ferme, nous avons cultivé un sanctuaire de sécurité et de liberté. L’endroit est devenu un espace où chacun de nous pouvait s’exprimer librement et ressentir l’amour et l’acceptation inconditionnels de la communauté. À travers chaque pratique, cérémonie et moment partagé, mon esprit a été lentement imprégné d’un profond sentiment d’appartenance et d’amour.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/yoga_group.jpg\" alt=\"Le groupe de yoga\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"étudier-la-théorie\">Étudier la théorie</h2>\n\n<p>Au milieu des riches rencontres sociales, mon exploration des origines et de la philosophie du yoga a ouvert de nouveaux horizons de compréhension pour moi. J’ai appris que le yoga était destiné à vous guider vers l’illumination et à vous aider à naviguer dans les souffrances inévitables de la vie avec grâce.</p>\n\n<p>En plongeant dans les Yoga Sutras de Patañjali, l’un des textes fondamentaux de la philosophie du yoga classique, j’ai été introduit aux 8 membres du yoga. Ce cadre complet m’a fourni des perspectives inestimables et a servi de plan pour une vie d’équilibre et d’harmonie. Les Yamas (restrictions éthiques) et les Niyamas (observances), par exemple, ont profondément résonné en moi. Les Yamas m’ont enseigné l’importance de la conduite éthique dans les interactions avec le monde, apprenant l’importance de pratiquer la non-violence, la véracité, l’intégrité, la modération et le non-attachement. Inversement, les Niyamas ont dirigé mon attention vers l’intérieur, soulignant l’importance de la propreté, du contentement, de la discipline, de l’étude de soi et de l’abandon à une puissance supérieure, comme piliers de la croissance personnelle et de l’illumination.</p>\n\n<p>Nos discussions ont également exploré le domaine du Karma, un concept qui m’avait captivé en lisant le livre de Sadhguru. Ces discussions ont mis en lumière la vérité profonde que chacune de nos actions, pensées et intentions crée des ondulations dans l’Univers. Le Karma n’est pas seulement une question de cause à effet ; il s’agit de réaliser des actions avec pureté et sans désirs égoïstes, purifiant ainsi nos cœurs et favorisant la croissance spirituelle. Comprendre le Karma comme une forme de service désintéressé m’a inspiré à vivre pour le bénéfice des autres, considérant ce service non seulement comme un acte de dévotion mais comme un chemin vers une spiritualité authentique. Cela est devenu la pierre angulaire de ma mission de vie, me guidant pour dédier ma vie à servir les autres avec un cœur ouvert.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"sortir-de-la-communauté\">Sortir de la communauté</h2>\n\n<p>Sortir de ce cadre idyllique et revenir dans le monde plus vaste, parsemé d’injustices et de déconnexion, a peut-être été la partie la plus difficile. Soudainement, je me suis retrouvé rappelé au matérialisme omniprésent et à la déconnexion qui caractérisent une grande partie de la société moderne.</p>\n\n<p>J’ai traversé des vagues de dépression en raison d’une lutte intérieure constante qui ne pouvait accepter que je retombe dans mes anciennes habitudes et redevienne mon ancien moi. J’avais l’impression d’avoir tellement évolué en quelques semaines, alors que le monde autour de moi n’avait pas changé d’un iota.</p>\n\n<p>L’attente et la pression de mon environnement et de mes relations pour que je me comporte exactement comme avant étaient étouffantes. Il m’a fallu des mois pour intégrer tout ce que j’avais appris et pour m’accepter pleinement moi-même et mon passé à nouveau.</p>\n\n<p>La vie que je menais, courant après le succès et le confort tel que défini par la société, m’éloignait de mon vrai moi. Les possessions matérielles, les titres de poste et la productivité n’avaient plus de sens pour moi. J’ai réalisé que je vivais une vie remplie de possessions mais vide de bonheur, une vie de conformité avec peu de place pour la croissance et l’authenticité. Pour trouver la paix et un but, je devais briser ces chaînes et m’éloigner du familier pour découvrir des vérités que la société néglige ou ignore délibérément.</p>\n\n<p>Heureusement, ce voyage loin du chemin conventionnel m’a conduit à une communauté d’âmes partageant les mêmes idées, des individus qui cherchaient également un sens au-delà du matériel, qui valorisaient la richesse de l’expérience plutôt que l’accumulation de choses. Dans cette communauté, j’ai trouvé une connexion plus profonde avec l’essence de la vie, une compréhension partagée qu’il y a plus à l’existence que ce que la culture dominante reconnaît.</p>\n\n<p>Alors que je navigue dans un monde trop caractérisé par son histoire, ses valeurs conservatrices et une dépendance croissante à la technologie, les leçons apprises grâce au yoga et les principes d’une approche plus durable et centrée sur l’humain de la vie n’ont jamais été aussi pertinentes. Maintenant, plus que jamais, il est impératif de plaider pour une société qui valorise l’esprit humain et la planète plutôt que la poursuite incessante du progrès technologique et de la croissance économique.</p>\n\n<p>En conclusion, mon parcours à travers le yoga a été</p>\n\n<p>bien plus qu’un chemin de croissance personnelle ; il a été un appel à remettre en question le statu quo, à chercher une vie riche en connexions, en authenticité et en but. C’est un rappel que le bonheur et l’épanouissement ne résident pas dans ce que nous possédons ou accomplissons, mais dans la profondeur de notre connexion avec nous-mêmes, avec les autres et finalement, avec notre Univers. En regardant vers l’avenir, j’espère porter cette sagesse avec moi et la répandre autour de moi, forgeant un chemin qui mène non seulement au bien-être individuel mais à la guérison du monde.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/sunset.jpeg\" alt=\"Coucher de soleil\" /></p>\n","url":"/fr/blog/yoga","relative_path":"_fr/posts/2024-03-27-yoga.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","name":"Atif Aziz","position":"Ingénieur Logiciel Principal chez Microsoft","image":"../images/atif.jpg","blurb":"Adrian ne recule devant aucun défi.

highs (sin juego de palabras) indudablemente hicieron que el viaje valiera la pena.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Ansioso por mantener mi impulso emprendedor, me uní a la última iniciativa de Capgemini: el escuadrón de datos.\n  Me imaginé embarcándome en una aventura parecida a una misión de James Bond digital.\n  Sin embargo, pronto me di cuenta de que nuestro proyecto \"súper genial\" esencialmente nos convertía en los conserjes del mundo digital, encargados de ordenar el caos de datos de mega-corporaciones en sistemas de software heredados.\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  Deseando un descanso de mi papel como el esbirro tecnológico de los señores corporativos, quería probar el mundo de los negocios y la estrategia.\n  Fue entonces cuando me encontré con OWT, un lugar donde los mejores emprendedores de

bienestar y crecimiento personal, permitiéndome evolucionar de una manera más completa y holística.\n    <br>\n    <br>\n    Además, mi viaje está profundamente arraigado en un compromiso con fomentar un futuro sostenible para nuestra sociedad y el planeta.\n    Mis esfuerzos, tanto personales como profesionales, están impulsados por una visión de lograr una armonía entre la humanidad y la

Los métodos tradicionales, como las encuestas y el análisis de bases de datos, a menudo son limitados en alcance y escalabilidad, lo que lleva a una falta de mapeo integral y a gran escala de las instalaciones solares. Esta brecha dificulta la toma de decisiones y las inversiones efectivas en tecnología solar.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"solución\">Solución</h3>\n<p>Este proyecto aborda el desafío aplicando un enfoque de aprendizaje automático supervisado, específicamente redes neuronales convolucionales (CNN), para la segmentación de imágenes a nivel de píxel de los paneles solares en azoteas.

X puede ser el coraje, la piedad, la justicia, la templanza o la sabiduría. Los protagonistas le dan ejemplos de estas palabras abstractas mientras intentan llegar a una definición. Pero Sócrates rechaza todas; siempre encuentra un uso de la palabra que no encaja en la definición dada.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"/images/socrates.jpg\" alt=\"Socrates\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"image-caption\"><em>Sócrates c. 470–399 BC</em></p>\n\n<p>En Eutifrón, por ejemplo, Sócrates y Eutifrón intentan establecer un significado definitivo para la palabra piedad. Sócrates pregunta: <em>“¿Qué es la piedad?”</em>, a lo que Eutifrón responde que la piedad es lo que él está haciendo en ese momento. Sócrates rechaza esta definición, porque la acción de Eutifrón es simplemente un ejemplo y no proporciona la característica esencial que hace que las acciones piadosas sean piadosas. Eutifrón intenta dar cuatro definiciones más, pero Sócrates sigue cuestionándolas (lo que se conoce como el <strong>cuestionamiento socrático</strong> o <strong>método socrático</strong>). Eutifrón termina perdiendo la paciencia y deja a Sócrates sin una definición clara de la piedad.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*JvZwMoSu7ABRDgQU\" alt=\"Eutifrón\" /></p>\n\n<p>Sócrates buscaba una naturaleza común entre los ejemplos que le daban para encontrar una definición real. Creía que la naturaleza común justificaba el uso del nombre común, que era poco ético usar palabras si su significado no era realmente conocido. Por ejemplo, uno solo podía ser justo si conocía la naturaleza común subyacente en la justicia. Pero ni Sócrates ni ninguno de los protagonistas de los diálogos socráticos logran encontrar definiciones verdaderas. El trabajo inacabado sugería que la filosofía aún tenía mucho por avanzar. En cualquier caso, Sócrates creía que ser consciente de su ignorancia lo hacía más sabio que aquellos que, aunque ignorantes, aún reclamaban conocimiento.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Solo sé que no sé nada.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>la paradoja socrática</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Siglos después, Ludwig Wittgenstein intentaría retomar el trabajo inacabado de Sócrates. Sin embargo, él creía que el enfoque de las personas al dar ejemplos de palabras era correcto.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>No puedo caracterizar mejor mi punto de vista que diciendo que es el punto de vista antitético al ocupado por Sócrates en los diálogos platónicos. Porque si me preguntaran qué es el conocimiento, enumeraría ejemplos de conocimiento y añadiría las palabras ‘y cosas similares’. No hay un componente común por descubrir ya que no existe.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Voices of Wittgenstein, Waismann &amp; Wittgenstein, 2003, p. 33</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/800/0*z-u5VJtjCSKd2xiL.webp\" alt=\"Wittgenstein\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"image-caption\"><em>Ludwig Wittgenstein 1889–1951</em></p>\n\n<p>En Investigaciones Filosóficas, considera ejemplos de la palabra juego para ilustrar su punto.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Considera por ejemplo los procedimientos que llamamos “juegos”. Me refiero a juegos de mesa, juegos de cartas, juegos de pelota, juegos olímpicos, y así sucesivamente. ¿Qué es lo común a todos ellos? No digas: “Debe haber algo en común, o no serían llamados ‘juegos’” — sino mira y ve si hay algo en común a todos. — Porque si los miras, no verás algo que sea común a todos, sino similitudes, relaciones, y toda una serie de ellas. Para repetir: ¡no pienses, sino mira!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Investigaciones Filosóficas, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 31</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein sugiere mirar en lugar de pensar, y describir en lugar de explicar. Pensar es un proceso abstracto sujeto al punto de vista corrompido de la mente, mientras que mirar es práctico y evita este sesgo. Wittgenstein argumentó que las cosas, que podrían pensarse que están conectadas por una característica común esencial, pueden de hecho estar conectadas por una serie de similitudes superpuestas, donde ninguna característica es común a todas las cosas. Acuñó este concepto como <strong>parecido de familia</strong>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>No puedo pensar en una mejor expresión para caracterizar estas similitudes que “parecidos de familia”;… Y diré: ‘los juegos’ forman una familia.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Investigaciones Filosóficas, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 32</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein no pensaba que las palabras correspondieran a cosas. La función y el significado de una palabra estaban determinados por su uso. La definición no es algo previo al uso de una palabra que fija su significado y determina cómo será utilizada, sino más bien una herramienta descriptiva que refleja las diversas formas en que se utiliza una palabra:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Piensa en las herramientas en una caja de herramientas: hay un martillo, unos alicates, una sierra, un destornillador, una regla, un bote de pegamento, clavos y tornillos. — Las funciones de las palabras son tan diversas como las funciones de estos objetos.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Investigaciones Filosóficas, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 6</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein veía el lenguaje simplemente como una herramienta utilizada para alcanzar metas y actividades cotidianas, que esencialmente determinan el significado de una palabra. Llamaba a estas actividades <strong>juegos de lenguaje</strong>, porque las reglas del lenguaje eran como las reglas de un juego, y decir algo era como hacer un movimiento en un juego.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Aquí el término “juego de lenguaje” tiene la intención de resaltar el hecho de que el hablar del lenguaje es parte de una actividad, o de una forma de vida.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Investigaciones Filosóficas, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 11</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Aunque nuestros cerebros asocian naturalmente imágenes a las palabras, incluso cuando se trata de palabras abstractas como justicia o alma, las palabras en realidad no nos dicen nada sobre la verdadera naturaleza de la cosa que representan. El punto principal de Wittgenstein era escapar de nuestras imágenes mentales al tratar con la filosofía, porque todos tenían una imagen diferente que nublaba la realidad.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Una imagen nos mantenía cautivos. Y no podíamos salir de ella, porque yacía en nuestro lenguaje y el lenguaje parecía repetírnosla inexorablemente.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Investigaciones Filosóficas, Wittgenstein, 1953, p. 48</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Por otro lado, incluso si uno pudiera encontrar una definición esencial de una palabra, esto no socavaría el argumento de Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein no está necesariamente en contra de las definiciones, porque en muchos casos existen definiciones esenciales e incluso son necesarias, típicamente en contextos científicos. Pero él simplemente no piensa que todas las palabras deben tener una definición esencial, por lo que sugiere el concepto de parecido de familia. Esto plantea la pregunta: <em>¿Cómo podemos saber qué términos tienen definiciones esenciales y cuáles no?</em> La afirmación de Wittgenstein hace que definir un concepto sea más fácil al reducir las expectativas de lo que se requiere, pero el desafío es mantenerse preciso.</p>\n\n<p>Wittgenstein valoraba la claridad más que la verdad universal, lo que realmente lo destacaba como filósofo. Los filósofos generalmente preguntan por qué para descubrir verdades ocultas y consideran que esto es lo más profundo que pueden hacer. Wittgenstein, por otro lado, consideraba que mirar era mucho más profundo y lo veía como una gran dificultad porque uno debe aprender a ignorar muchas preconcepciones que nublan nuestro juicio. Wittgenstein afirmando que no hay un componente común en el conocimiento típicamente sería reprendido por la mayoría de los filósofos, particularmente Sócrates, porque renuncia a la búsqueda de la verdad. Aunque Wittgenstein da respuestas válidas a muchas de las preguntas de la filosofía, inevitablemente plantea más preguntas, como qué términos tienen definiciones esenciales y cuáles no. Al igual que en el caso de Sócrates, queda trabajo por hacer en este aspecto. Pero en respuesta a muchos de sus críticos, Wittgenstein diría:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Lo místico no es cómo es el mundo, sino que es.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 1922</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n","url":"/es/blog/wittgenstein","relative_path":"_es/posts/2020-04-14-wittgenstein.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","permalink":"/es/blog/:slug","date":"2021-01-28 00:00:00 -0600","title":"7 Lecciones para Estudiantes Emprendedores","description":"7 valiosas lecciones para ayudar a otros estudiantes emprendedores a avanzar con sus metas y ambiciones.","tags":["carrera","emprendimiento"],"image":"/images/woods_antoinebruy.jpg","slug":"7-lessons","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p><em>Este artículo es para estudiantes emprendedores ansiosos por poner en marcha su startup.

Pasé más de un año trabajando en un proyecto de startup como estudiante en el Instituto Federal Suizo de Tecnología en Lausana (EPFL). Aprendí algunas lecciones valiosas que espero puedan ayudar a otros estudiantes con mentalidad emprendedora a avanzar con sus metas y ambiciones.</em></p>\n\n<p>El emprendimiento siempre comienza con una idea. Pero las ideas no importan tanto como pensamos inicialmente. El esfuerzo sostenido, las lecciones de tu viaje y, en última instancia, las lecciones sobre ti mismo importan mucho más.</p>\n\n<p>Lanzar una startup es una iniciativa importante. Más aún si implica rechazar o renunciar a un trabajo. Cuando comencé, estaba enfocado en hacer que mis ideas se hicieran realidad. Realmente no sabía en lo que me estaba metiendo — gracias a Dios, porque de lo contrario no lo habría hecho.</p>\n\n<p>El emprendimiento es un viaje increíble. Una startup es mucho más que solo ideas. Una visión clara es crucial para reclutar un equipo diverso de jugadores de primera. Pero solo al ponerte constantemente en la primera línea, asumir responsabilidades y mostrar el camino a seguir, ganarás completamente la confianza y el apoyo de tu equipo.</p>\n\n<p>Aquí hay algunas lecciones clave de mi experiencia como estudiante emprendedor:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-acepta-el-fracaso\">1. Acepta el fracaso.</h2>\n<p>Vas a fracasar. Pero está bien, porque el fracaso es parte de la vida.</p>\n\n<p>Elon Musk, uno de los más grandes emprendedores de nuestra generación, dijo que pensaba que SpaceX y Tesla fracasarían, pero estaba perfectamente bien con eso. Cuando la gente me preguntaba sobre los riesgos de fracasar, yo decía que si fracasaba, me iría felizmente a vivir en la naturaleza.</p>\n\n<p>Si quieres pensar como un emprendedor, prepárate para fracasar. Me encontré con un equipo de brillantes estudiantes emprendedores que trabajaron muy duro en su proyecto durante demasiado tiempo. Terminaron disgustados con el emprendimiento cuando decidieron tirar la toalla. Es una pena, realmente, porque las startups están destinadas a ser divertidas. Con demasiada frecuencia, escuchamos historias épicas de emprendedores que logran sacar una victoria cuando las cosas parecen sombrías, pero rara vez escuchamos sobre los innumerables otros que no lo hacen. Cuando tu startup ha perdido tracción, admitir el fracaso es probablemente una de las cosas más difíciles pero mejores que puedes hacer.</p>\n\n<p>Acepta el fracaso. Admitirás la derrota más fácilmente cuando tu startup se esté hundiendo. Más importante aún: intentarás más, aprenderás más y lograrás más.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-comunica\">2. Comunica.</h2>\n<p>Si estás lanzando una startup, quieres difundir la palabra lo más posible porque nunca sabes quién podría brindarte ayuda crucial en el futuro.</p>\n\n<p>Al agregar miembros al equipo, ten en cuenta que el éxito de tu equipo depende de una buena comunicación en toda tu startup. No solo los miembros adicionales del equipo crean una sobrecarga significativa de comunicación (ver la Ley de Brooks a continuación), sino que también pueden representar un riesgo si esa persona no encaja con la cultura de la startup.</p>\n\n<p>Ley de Brooks: un tamaño grande del equipo representa una sobrecarga significativa en términos de comunicación.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*pLdfse5oA5nJOEjemvmgig.webp\" alt=\"Líneas de comunicación\" /></p>\n\n<p>Trata a tu equipo como a tu familia: trabajas para ellos, ellos no trabajan para ti. Prepárate para adaptarte a las necesidades de tu equipo y asegúrate de que las personas que dejas entrar tengan tanto la capacidad como la personalidad para trabajar en una startup. Una persona tóxica puede ser suficiente para arruinar la diversión. Perder miembros del equipo es una de las peores cosas que le puede pasar a una startup, porque la fuerza laboral es muy pequeña.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"3-no-pienses-actúa\">3. No pienses, actúa.</h2>\n<p>Pensar demasiado es un problema clásico de pérdida de tiempo para emprendedores inexpertos. Evita la parálisis por análisis simplificando los asuntos en cuestión. En este sentido, reconocer decisiones de puerta de un solo sentido y de puerta de dos sentidos puede ayudar.</p>\n\n<p>Las decisiones de puerta de un solo sentido son decisiones que no se pueden revertir fácilmente. Estas deben hacerse metódicamente, con cuidado, lentamente, con gran deliberación y consulta. Las decisiones de puerta de dos sentidos, por otro lado, se pueden revertir. Puedes atravesar la puerta, ver si te gusta y, si no, volver atrás. Estas decisiones deben automatizarse o delegarse. La mayoría de las decisiones son decisiones de puerta de dos sentidos, así que aprende a tomarlas lo más rápido posible.</p>\n\n<p>En general, busca desarrollar hábitos que te permitan actuar y reflexionar de manera efectiva, mientras te deshaces de los malos también. Aprende a decir no, para enfocarte en lo que dices sí.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"4-escucha-atentamente\">4. Escucha atentamente.</h2>\n<p>Solo porque estás dirigiendo una startup, no significa que siempre tengas razón.</p>\n\n<p>Escucha atentamente a todos a tu alrededor: tu equipo, tus clientes, tus socios, tus amigos. Rodéate de personas que piensen de manera diferente. Alienta a los miembros del equipo a generar y compartir nuevas ideas. Aprecia escuchar cosas que te hagan sentir incómodo.</p>\n\n<p>Habla con los clientes. Ponte en los zapatos de otras personas. Aprende a pensar en lo que no estás pensando. La verdad puede doler, pero la falta de verdad dolerá aún más a largo plazo.</p>\n\n<p>No caigas en la trampa de seguir ciegamente lo que otros dicen. A todos les gusta pensar que saben algunas cosas sobre negocios. Aprende a notar a las personas que hablan por vanidad — probablemente no son las personas de las que deberías seguir consejos o incluso discutir. Lee a las personas desde sus emociones, en lugar de sus palabras.</p>\n\n<p>Al final, debes formar tus propias opiniones. Usa la capacidad cerebral colectiva de las personas a tu alrededor para hacer la mayor parte del pensamiento — tú solo estás orquestando.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"5-confía-en-ti-mismo\">5. Confía en ti mismo.</h2>\n<p>Busca progreso constante, en lugar de metas ambiciosas e irreales.</p>\n\n<p>Siempre habrá cosas que no puedes controlar. Cuando las metas o expectativas no se alcancen, mantén una visión objetiva para contentarte con el progreso constante. No seas demasiado duro contigo mismo ni con los demás — todos están haciendo lo mejor que pueden. Hazlo el tiempo suficiente y eventualmente ganarás la lotería. Todos tienen suerte a veces.</p>\n\n<p>La definición de éxito también es altamente subjetiva. En última instancia, el único que puede juzgar si estás teniendo éxito o no, eres tú. Cree en ti mismo. Eres capaz de ser quien te propongas ser. Sueña. Ten fe.</p>\n\n<p>Finalmente, los líderes deben tener suficiente carácter para generar confianza. Sin confianza, no tienes seguidores. Sin seguidores, ¿a quién lideras? Comienza confiando en ti mismo. Confiarás más fácilmente en los demás y los demás confiarán más en ti también.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"6-mejora-tus-relaciones\">6. Mejora tus relaciones.</h2>\n<p>Busca mejorar tus relaciones, comenzando con las más cercanas a ti. Cuando comencé mi viaje emprendedor, no solo estaba tomando algo de riesgo, quería lanzar una startup de cannabis. Puedes imaginar que mis padres no estaban totalmente de acuerdo.</p>\n\n<p>El camino de una startup es largo, necesitas depender del entusiasmo de otras personas para seguir adelante. Haz que tu familia y amigos se suban a tu visión. No solo te proporcionará un valioso apoyo moral, sino que más personas querrán ayudarte.</p>\n\n<p>El emprendimiento es como el deporte. Cuando pierdes, tienes que ser el primero en levantarte para animar a los miembros del equipo a continuar, sin importar cuán duro haya sido el golpe que acabas de recibir. Cuando las cosas van mal, no te rindas. Cuando las cosas van bien, sé realista.</p>\n\n<p>Mejorar todas tus relaciones te ayudará a liderar con más empatía y a difundir positividad en tu startup. Todos disfrutarán mucho más del viaje.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"7-conócete-a-ti-mismo\">7. Conócete a ti mismo.</h2>\n<p>Algunas preguntas filosóficas que debes hacerte constantemente durante tu viaje:</p>\n\n<p>¿Quién eres?\n¿Por qué haces lo que haces?\n¿Cuál es el cambio que te gustaría ver en el mundo?\nLa filosofía actúa como una brújula moral. Indagar en tu comprensión de la realidad, el conocimiento y cómo deberías vivir te proporcionará principios que te ayudarán a no sentirte perdido nunca más en la vida.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“La ciencia es lo que sabes. La filosofía es lo que no sabes.”</p>\n\n  <p>Bertrand Russell</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reserva tiempo regularmente para relajarte y reflexionar. Construye tu carácter. Recuerda, estás jugando el juego a largo plazo, así que esfuérzate por mantenerte saludable a largo plazo. Calmar tu mente impulsará tu creatividad. Mis mejores ideas vienen mientras me relajo, no cuando las busco desesperadamente.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"reflexiones-finales\">Reflexiones finales</h2>\n<p>Para resumir, enfócate en ti mismo y el resto seguirá. A veces tendrás que ser paciente, pero el trabajo duro vale la pena.</p>\n\n<p>Muchas de las lecciones que aprendí, así como varios hábitos que adopté, fueron inspirados por el estoicismo. Los principios estoicos proporcionan formas útiles y prácticas de encontrar tranquilidad y mejorar la fortaleza del carácter de uno. Algunos de los más grandes líderes de la historia han seguido la filosofía estoica.</p>\n\n","url":"/es/blog/7-lessons","relative_path":"_es/posts/2021-01-28-7-lessons.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"project","permalink":"/es/portfolio/:slug","date":"2021-03-01 00:00:00 -0600","title":"Análisis de Sentimiento Social sobre el Consumo de CBD","subtitle":"Procesamiento de Lenguaje Natural","image":"/images/hemp-oil.jpg","slug":"CBD","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<h3 id=\"problema\">Problema</h3>\n<p>A pesar de la creciente popularidad de los productos de Cannabidiol (CBD), falta evidencia científica concluyente sobre sus beneficios para la salud.

Este proyecto subraya el potencial de los métodos avanzados de NLP en la minería de datos de redes sociales para rastrear el sentimiento público y los patrones de uso relacionados con productos de salud como el CBD. Destaca la importancia de la vigilancia de las redes sociales como un método rápido, conveniente y rentable para complementar las fuentes tradicionales de vigilancia. Los hallazgos también sugieren la necesidad de más investigación y una mejor comunicación en salud pública sobre los efectos y posibles beneficios del consumo de CBD.</p>\n","url":"/es/portfolio/cbd","relative_path":"_es/projects/2021-03-01-CBD.md"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"project","permalink":"/es/portfolio/:slug","date":"2021-07-29 22:20:35 -0500","title":"Análisis de Negocios para una Aplicación de Predicción de Precios Inmobiliarios","subtitle":"Análisis de Negocios","image":"/images/swiss_real_estate.jpg","slug":"ba-real-estate","ext":".md","tags":[],"excerpt":"<h3 id=\"problema\">Problema</h3>\n<p>El mercado inmobiliario en Suiza está altamente regulado y es complejo, lo que hace que la valoración precisa de propiedades sea un desafío para los vendedores de bienes raíces.

A pesar del resultado final, las lecciones fueron invaluables. Hoy, me siento más resiliente que nunca para enfrentar los próximos desafíos que la vida me arrojará.</em></p>\n\n<p>Mientras estudiaba mi Maestría en EPFL, me di cuenta de lo afortunado que era al tener un ecosistema de startups que ofrecía apoyo a estudiantes emprendedores. La universidad realmente parecía el mejor momento para lanzar una startup. También me motivó para mis estudios: ya no quería simplemente terminarlos, quería disfrutar de la experiencia y quedarme un poco más.</p>\n\n<p>La ingenuidad, la curiosidad y un fuerte deseo de expresar mi creatividad me empujaron hacia el emprendimiento. La serie de acciones que siguieron me hicieron crecer de formas que no podría haber imaginado. Asumir responsabilidades, comunicarme regularmente y confiar en las personas adecuadas fueron habilidades que no podría haber desarrollado en un aula o a través de un libro de texto. Si hubiera sabido lo difícil que sería el camino emprendedor, nunca lo habría seguido en primer lugar.</p>\n\n<p>Comencé a hacer una lluvia de ideas, pero finalmente me decidí por el Vivino del CBD. Mi padre se estaba convirtiendo en un verdadero experto en vinos gracias a Vivino, mientras que un amigo estaba a punto de comenzar un trabajo en un negocio de CBD. Probé CBD para el sueño, el estrés, el dolor muscular e incluso como parte de mis prácticas espirituales. Descubrí cuánto había de ciencia en la planta de cannabis, pero cuán poco se presentaba al público.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*RapTk4VMeNkn3yNC\" alt=\"CBD\" /></p>\n\n<p>Compañeros de la universidad me recomendaron un curso de startups impartido por la Agencia Suiza de Innovación. Los participantes tenían que presentar su idea con la esperanza de trabajar en ella a lo largo del curso. Los proyectos seleccionados tendrían la oportunidad de reclutar miembros del equipo y contar con entrenadores que les proporcionaran retroalimentación regularmente. Uno de ellos se convertiría en mi mentor y socio comercial: Haider Alleg.</p>\n\n<p>Pero las cosas podrían haber sido muy diferentes desde el principio. Haider se perdió la ronda de introducción entre los entrenadores y las startups. Un par de semanas después, recibí un largo hilo de correos electrónicos entre Haider y otro entrenador. Haider había estado tratando de contactarme, pero los mensajes habían terminado en el buzón equivocado.</p>\n\n<p>Cuando finalmente logramos programar nuestra primera reunión en persona, llegó más de una hora tarde. Entré a nuestra reunión molesto, pero salí asombrado por el impulso que ya nos estaba dando. Me envió un duplicado de su sitio web de Wordpress para un proyecto similar, en el cual había invertido tiempo y dinero. Necesitaba algunos ajustes, pero en una semana podríamos tener nuestro producto mínimo viable.</p>\n\n<p>Desafortunadamente, la emoción no duró. El trabajo del curso, los plazos de los proyectos y los exámenes del último año tomaban más tiempo del esperado. Además, mi equipo no estaba ayudando tanto como esperaba. Me sentía abrumado.</p>\n\n<p>No obstante, el aporte de Haider nos mantuvo en marcha. Sus consejos eran tan valiosos que a veces me tomaba meses darme cuenta de cosas que había estado diciendo todo el tiempo. Cuando el curso terminó, mis compañeros de equipo dejaron el proyecto. Haider no podía imaginarme avanzando sin equipo y sin dinero.</p>\n\n<p>Aun así, no sentía que fuera el momento de rendirme. Comencé a contactar a amigos que pensé podrían estar interesados en el proyecto. Una vez que recluté a los primeros miembros de mi equipo, las cosas cambiaron: la gente venía a ofrecer ayuda. Entramos en nuestra mejor fase de luna de miel hasta el momento. ¡Lanzar una startup era divertido!</p>\n\n<p>Todo fue abrazos y besos hasta que un día, mi amigo que escribía artículos de blog me dijo que se iba. Estaba devastado, pero no perdí tiempo en buscar nuevos posibles reclutas.</p>\n\n<p>Estaba discutiendo términos con un nuevo cofundador, cuando Haider llamó. Tenía un nuevo proyecto para mí. Su amigo había desarrollado una plataforma de comercio de productos agrícolas y quería desplegarla en nuevas industrias como el cannabis. Al principio, fui reacio. ¿Cómo podía dejar ir todo lo logrado en el último año? Después de ver la plataforma, se hizo más claro que este proyecto requería mi atención plena e indiscutida.</p>\n\n<p>Cancelé el proyecto anterior y comencé a dedicarme al nuevo. Teníamos reuniones cada semana. Yo era el más joven de los tres, por lo que cada reunión era increíblemente estimulante: ¡estaba aprendiendo mucho!</p>\n\n<p>Avanzando 10 meses después, una mezcla de circunstancias — incluyendo la falta de experiencia de mi parte — nos hizo perder tracción. La dinámica del equipo ya no estaba en sintonía y eventualmente, acordamos que la mejor solución era separarnos.</p>\n\n<p>Curiosamente, tirar del enchufe la segunda vez fue mucho más fácil que la primera.

Colaborativamente, identificamos cuatro posibles aplicaciones de ciencia de datos para su mercado: recomendaciones de productos, predicciones de tiempo de entrega, precios dinámicos y optimización de rutas de entrega. Después de evaluar la disponibilidad de datos y la viabilidad de cada opción, decidimos iniciar una prueba de concepto enfocada en recomendaciones de productos dentro del segmento de alimentos.</p>\n\n<p>Solo en 2023, el segmento de alimentos representó más de 205,000 pedidos, generando aproximadamente $6 millones en ingresos para el mercado. Las bases de datos de la empresa estaban llenas de datos subutilizados que no se habían aprovechado para propósitos analíticos ni para decisiones de gestión basadas en datos. Además, la interfaz de usuario existente carecía de cualquier forma de recomendaciones personalizadas. El objetivo del cliente era explorar el potencial de la ciencia de datos para mejorar la experiencia del usuario ofreciendo recomendaciones de alimentos personalizadas.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"solución\">Solución</h3>\n\n<p>Identificamos los requisitos de datos para construir un pipeline de recomendaciones de productos y recolectamos los datos necesarios.

Intenta disfrutar el viaje, en realidad es bastante divertido.</em></p>\n\n<p>Comencé mi carrera siendo despedido de mi propio proyecto de startup. Lejos de desanimarme, eso me dio fuerza y claridad para enfrentar nuevos desafíos.</p>\n\n<p>Después de un periodo de gastar dinero, necesitaba encontrar una manera de generar ingresos estables mientras ganaba experiencia para algún día lanzar mi propio negocio.</p>\n\n<p>La consultoría parecía responder mejor a esas necesidades. Sin embargo, mi entorno no parecía tan entusiasmado:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“No empiezas una carrera en consultoría.”</p>\n\n  <p>“Los ingenieros que trabajan en consultoría desperdician su potencial.”</p>\n\n  <p>“La consultoría es un trabajo duro. ¿Puedes manejarlo?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Además, mi experiencia inicial en consultoría había sido bastante agitada, por decir lo menos.</p>\n\n<p>Después de graduarme de EPFL, mi mentor de startup me contrató para un trabajo de consultoría. Él, su cliente y yo nos reunimos una tarde para discutir un proyecto. Establecimos plazos, definimos un alcance y comencé mi proyecto de verano.</p>\n\n<p>Unas semanas después, mi mentor desapareció sin previo aviso. Se fue de vacaciones y se desconectó completamente durante casi un mes. Inesperadamente, me quedé a cargo del cliente por mi cuenta.</p>\n\n<p>El cliente estaba ansioso por revolucionar la industria inmobiliaria con tecnología, mientras que yo estaba más enfocado en cumplir con las expectativas. Sentía que mi trabajo colgaba de un hilo, pero logré entregar un informe detallando modelos de precios inmobiliarios que posteriormente se utilizarían.</p>\n\n<p>Semanas después de quitarme esa carga de encima, mi startup se derrumbó. Mis últimos dos años se desvanecieron en un abrir y cerrar de ojos. Afortunadamente, la feria de empleo de mi universidad estaba a la vuelta de la esquina. En el mercado con una historia de fracaso de startup para contar, todas las empresas querían contratarme.</p>\n\n<p>Saltando varias rondas de entrevistas, me uní a la práctica de Insights and Data de Capgemini como Analista de Datos. Un equipo nuevo compuesto por consultores frescos ansiosos de éxito, liderado por un consultor distinguido y experimentado. Estábamos decididos a atacar el mercado suizo, que estaba maduro para la digitalización después de la pandemia. En teoría, el proyecto parecía emocionante, pero en realidad, estaba destinado al desastre. No disfrutaba mi experiencia allí, así que me fui poco después.</p>\n\n<p>Durante la feria de empleo, también estuve en contacto con Open Web Technology, una firma de consultoría más pequeña pero de buena reputación. Aunque mi cabeza me llevó hacia Capgemini, mi corazón siempre latió por Open Web. La entrevista en el sitio me dejó una gran impresión: eran una pequeña familia de emprendedores con un trasfondo similar al mío. Después de dejar Capgemini, supe dónde quería estar.</p>\n\n<p>El trabajo no decepcionó. Unos meses después, realmente creí que había encontrado el trabajo de mis sueños. Estaba aprendiendo mucho, los eventos de equipo eran divertidos y, a diferencia de antes, mi voz era escuchada.</p>\n\n<p>Naturalmente, comencé a asumir cada vez más responsabilidades. Con la llegada de los fríos días de invierno, sin embargo, comencé a sentirme abrumado. “¿Había asumido demasiado demasiado rápido?”, me preguntaba. Todo estaba sucediendo tan rápido que no tenía tiempo para detenerme y reflexionar. Mientras entregábamos mi proyecto más grande hasta la fecha, tomé un tiempo libre y me di cuenta de que la empresa y yo ya no estábamos alineados. No estaba creciendo como quería, así que renuncié poco después.</p>\n\n<p>Sin embargo, aprendí algunas lecciones importantes de mis experiencias:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Una empresa más grande no necesariamente significa que sea mejor para ti. A medida que las empresas crecen, se vuelven menos propensas a asumir riesgos. Su enfoque cambia hacia mantener las ganancias y la cuota de mercado. Idealmente, deberías encontrar una empresa con la que puedas crecer.</li>\n  <li>Mi generación está acostumbrada a las victorias rápidas y las recompensas rápidas (gracias, smartphones). Cuando no las recibimos de inmediato, nos decepcionamos. Esto es importante tenerlo en cuenta porque construir confianza lleva tiempo. Basado en mis experiencias, toma aún más tiempo con las generaciones mayores.</li>\n  <li>Pasar por varias rondas de entrevistas es en realidad beneficioso. Conoces a más personas y obtienes una mejor idea del trabajo. Esto te dará una mejor idea de qué esperar una vez que empieces a trabajar.</li>\n  <li>Cuando empiezas un nuevo trabajo, no estás comenzando de cero, estás comenzando desde la experiencia. Tu experiencia es lo que te distingue de los demás.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>La vida es un viaje. El destino no importa tanto como las experiencias en el camino. Para mí, ese viaje apenas está comenzando.</p>\n","url":"/es/blog/finding-my-path","relative_path":"_es/posts/2023-03-01-finding-my-path.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"post","permalink":"/es/blog/:slug","date":"2024-03-27 00:00:00 -0500","title":"Cómo el Yoga me Transformó","description":"El yoga ha desencadenado un profundo viaje de autodescubrimiento y sanación para mí; empujando continuamente los límites y abrazando nuevas formas de vivir con un corazón abierto y un espíritu ansioso.","tags":["viajes","vida","historia"],"image":"/images/ytt.jpg","slug":"yoga","ext":".markdown","excerpt":"<p><em>Sintiendo agotamiento por mi último trabajo e inseguridad sobre mis próximos pasos, decidí perseguir una aspiración de toda la vida: una Formación de Instructores de Yoga.

No solo quería entender la causa de mi malestar, sino también explorar formas de ejercicio más suaves y en sintonía con mi cuerpo.</p>\n\n<p>Casualmente, una amiga que había estado siguiendo el camino de convertirse en instructora de yoga estaba invitando a la gente a unirse a sus clases. Me había inspirado mucho su viaje, así que decidí asistir a mi primera clase: una sesión de yoga yin.</p>\n\n<p>En medio de una pasantía de verano donde el estrés era un compañero constante, mi primera sesión me ofreció un reinicio inesperado; me desperté al día siguiente completamente desorientado, sin saber dónde estaba ni qué día de la semana era. Me sentía profundamente descansado y completamente rejuvenecido.</p>\n\n<p>El impacto del yoga fue tan profundo que estaba decidido a seguir practicando. Pero no fue hasta el confinamiento por la pandemia que se convirtió en una parte esencial de mi vida. Gracias a la aplicación Down Dog, comencé a practicar yoga desde casa y a adaptar las sesiones a mis preferencias. Podía elegir cualquier área del cuerpo en la que enfocarme e incluso preestablecer la duración de cada clase. El yoga se integró sin problemas en mi rutina diaria.</p>\n\n<p>Unos meses después de comenzar mi práctica de yoga, sus efectos en mi cuerpo se hicieron evidentes. Dejé de roncar, me volví más reacio a beber alcohol y más consciente del impacto de diferentes alimentos en mi cuerpo. Con el tiempo, el yoga mejoró muchos otros aspectos de mi vida, como mi equilibrio físico, enfoque mental, tolerancia al dolor, alergias, mi capacidad para procesar emociones y adaptabilidad a nuevos entornos. Pero lo más importante, amplió mi mentalidad permitiéndome experimentar y beneficiarme de otras disciplinas también.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"entrar-en-una-formación-de-instructores-de-yoga\">Entrar en una Formación de Instructores de Yoga</h2>\n\n<p>Transicionando de la vida universitaria y una aventura emprendedora, me encontré navegando por varios roles dentro del mundo corporativo. Sin embargo, después de mi último trabajo, me sentía desconectado y agotado. En medio de un período de incertidumbre, seguir una Formación de Instructores de Yoga emergió como un faro esperanzador de claridad.</p>\n\n<p>Mi corazón estaba puesto en el Lago Atitlán en Guatemala, un lugar cuya comunidad mágica me había cautivado anteriormente y prometía la profundidad de inmersión que anhelaba. Consideré varios lugares, y finalmente me decidí por la Granja de Yoga Mística como el lugar para mi formación. Nunca había estado allí, pero estaba listo para salir de los confines familiares de mi zona de confort.</p>\n\n<p>La granja resultó ofrecer una variedad de actividades que nutrieron la mente, el cuerpo y el espíritu. Con sesiones de yoga, danzas extáticas vibrantes, temazcales tradicionales y pacíficos baños matutinos en el lago, este lugar era ideal para recuperarse de los grandes trastornos de la vida. Más allá de mi práctica de yoga, adquirí numerosas técnicas y prácticas de bienestar que todavía utilizo hoy.</p>\n\n<p>La comunidad también fue especial y jugó un papel crucial en mi recuperación. Junto con todos en la granja, cultivamos un santuario de seguridad y libertad. El lugar se convirtió en un espacio donde cada uno de nosotros podía expresarse libremente y experimentar el cálido amor y aceptación incondicional de la comunidad. A través de cada práctica, ceremonia y momento compartido, mi espíritu se infundió lentamente con un profundo sentido de pertenencia y amor.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/yoga_group.jpg\" alt=\"El Grupo de Yoga\" /></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"estudiando-la-teoría\">Estudiando la teoría</h2>\n\n<p>En medio de los ricos encuentros sociales, mi exploración de los orígenes y la filosofía del yoga abrió nuevos horizontes de entendimiento para mí. Aprendí que el yoga estaba destinado a guiarte hacia la iluminación y ayudarte a navegar los inevitables sufrimientos de la vida con gracia.</p>\n\n<p>Sumergiéndome en los Yoga Sutras de Patañjali, uno de los textos fundamentales de la filosofía del yoga clásico, fui introducido a los 8 miembros del yoga. Este marco integral me proporcionó ideas invaluables y actuó como un plano para una vida de equilibrio y armonía. Los Yamas (restricciones éticas) y los Niyamas (observancias), por ejemplo, resonaron profundamente conmigo. Los Yamas me enseñaron la importancia de la conducta ética en las interacciones con el mundo, aprendiendo la importancia de practicar la no violencia, la veracidad, la integridad, la moderación y el desapego. Por el contrario, los Niyamas dirigieron mi enfoque hacia adentro, destacando la importancia de la limpieza, el contentamiento, la disciplina, el autoestudio y la rendición a un poder superior como pilares para el crecimiento personal y la iluminación.</p>\n\n<p>Nuestras discusiones también se adentraron en el ámbito del Karma, un concepto que me había cautivado al leer el libro de Sadhguru. Estas discusiones arrojaron luz sobre la profunda verdad de que cada una de nuestras acciones, pensamientos e intenciones generan ondas en el Universo. El Karma no se trata solo de causa y efecto; se trata de realizar acciones con pureza y sin deseos egoístas, limpiando así nuestros corazones y fomentando el crecimiento espiritual. Entender el Karma como una forma de servicio desinteresado me inculcó el compromiso de vivir para el beneficio de los demás, viendo dicho servicio no solo como un acto de devoción sino como un camino hacia la espiritualidad auténtica. Esto se ha convertido en la piedra angular del propósito de mi vida, guiándome a dedicar mi vida a servir a los demás con un corazón abierto.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"saliendo-de-la-comunidad\">Saliendo de la comunidad</h2>\n\n<p>Salir de este entorno idílico y volver al mundo exterior, plagado de injusticia y desconexión, fue quizás la parte más difícil. De repente, me encontré recordando el materialismo y la desconexión omnipresentes que definen gran parte de la sociedad moderna.</p>\n\n<p>Entré en olas de depresión debido a una constante lucha interna que no podía aceptar que volviera a caer en viejos hábitos y me convirtiera en mi antiguo yo otra vez. Sentía que había evolucionado tanto en solo unas pocas semanas, pero el mundo a mi alrededor no había cambiado ni un ápice.</p>\n\n<p>La expectativa y la presión de mi entorno y relaciones para comportarme exactamente como solía hacerlo eran sofocantes. Me tomó meses integrar todo lo que había aprendido y aceptar completamente a mí mismo y a mi pasado nuevamente.</p>\n\n<p>La vida que llevaba, persiguiendo el éxito y la comodidad según lo definido por la sociedad, me alejaba de mi verdadero ser. Las posesiones materiales, los títulos de trabajo y la productividad ya no tenían sentido para mí. Me di cuenta de que había estado viviendo una vida llena de posesiones pero carente de felicidad, una vida de conformidad con poco espacio para el crecimiento y la autenticidad. Para encontrar paz y propósito, tuve que liberarme de estas cadenas y alejarme de lo familiar para descubrir verdades que la sociedad pasa por alto o ignora deliberadamente.</p>\n\n<p>Afortunadamente, este viaje lejos del camino convencional me llevó a una comunidad de almas afines, individuos que también buscaban un significado más allá de lo material, que valoraban la riqueza de la experiencia por encima de la acumulación de cosas. En esta comunidad, encontré una conexión más profunda con la esencia de la vida, un entendimiento compartido de que hay más en la existencia de lo que la cultura dominante reconoce.</p>\n\n<p>Mientras navego por un mundo caracterizado en exceso por su historia, valores conservadores y una creciente dependencia de la tecnología, las lecciones aprendidas a través del yoga y los principios de un enfoque más sostenible y centrado en el ser humano nunca han sido más relevantes. Ahora, más que nunca, es imperativo que aboguemos por una sociedad que valore el espíritu humano y el planeta por encima de la búsqueda implacable del avance tecnológico y el crecimiento económico.</p>\n\n<p>En conclusión, mi viaje a través del yoga ha sido mucho más que un camino hacia el crecimiento personal; ha sido un llamado a desafiar el statu quo, a buscar una vida rica en conexión, autenticidad y propósito. Es un recordatorio de que la felicidad y la realización no residen en lo que poseemos o logramos, sino en qué tan profundamente nos conectamos con nosotros mismos, con los demás y, en última instancia, con nuestro Universo. Al mirar hacia adelante, espero llevar esta sabiduría conmigo y difundirla a mi alrededor, forjando un camino que no solo conduzca al bienestar individual sino a la sanación del mundo.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/sunset.jpeg\" alt=\"Atardecer\" /></p>\n","url":"/es/blog/yoga","relative_path":"_es/posts/2024-03-27-yoga.markdown"},{"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"default","name":"Atif Aziz","position":"Ingeniero de Software Principal en Microsoft","image":"../images/atif.jpg","blurb":"Adrian no se aleja de los desafíos.
